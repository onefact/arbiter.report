Lieutenant-General Igor Kirillov, who commands the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces of Russia, presented documents and imagery showing why the military has come to such a conclusion.  \u201cWe believe that components of biological weapons were being made on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d said Kirillov.  He noted that the documents he was presenting \u201chave the signatures of real officials and are certified by the seals of organizations,\u201d for those journalists and experts in the West doubting their veracity.  One document, dated March 6, 2015 confirms the \u201cdirect participation of the Pentagon in the financing of military biological projects in Ukraine,\u201d Kirillov said. The US officially funded the projects through the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, according to the Agreement on Joint Biological Activities. However, the evidence shows that the real recipients of some $32 million in funds were Ukrainian Defense Ministry laboratories in Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Kharkov.  READ MORE: Russia promises more disclosures on Ukraine biolabs  These facilities were chosen by the US Department of Defense\u2019s Threat Reduction Administration (DTRA), and the contractor Black and Veatch, to carry out the U-P-8 project, aimed at studying the pathogens of Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis, and hantaviruses, Kirillov said, pointing to a slide with the Pentagon\u2019s request.  \u201cFrom our point of view, the interest of US military biologists is due to the fact that these pathogens have natural foci both in Ukraine and in Russia, and their use can be disguised as natural disease outbreaks,\u201d the general said.  According to the evidence, the labs isolated three bacterial pathogens (causing plague, brucellosis and leptospirosis) and six families of viruses, including coronaviruses, all of which were drug-resistant and spread rapidly from animals to humans. A number of documents confirmed the samples taken in Ukraine to other countries \u2013 Georgia, Germany, and the UK.  Kirillov showed official documents confirming the transfer of 5,000 samples of blood serum taken from Ukrainian citizens to the Pentagon-backed Richard Lugar center in Tbilisi, Georgia. Another 773 biological assays were transferred to the UK, while an agreement was signed for the transfer of \u201cunlimited quantities\u201d of infectious materials to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, Germany\u2019s leading center for animal diseases.  READ MORE: US-funded labs in Ukraine dealt with bat coronavirus, Moscow claims  However, the analysis of the obtained evidence suggests that Ukrainian specialists were not aware of the potential risks of transferring these materials, and may have been kept in the dark about the true goal of the ongoing research, Kirillov noted.  Documents from Project P-781, a study of ways of transmitting diseases to humans through bats, showed it was carried out by the Kharkov laboratory and the Lugar Center in Georgia, but Ukraine received most of the $1.6 million grant for the project. Kirillov said that \u201csystematic\u201d research in this area has been carried out since 2009, under the supervision of US specialists \u2013 referencing projects P-382, P-444 and P-568.  As one of the key people involved, Kirillov named the head of the DTRA office at the US Embassy in Kiev, Joanna Wintrol.  \u201cMaybe she\u2019s worth talking to, journalists?\u201d he said.  Wintrol left Kiev in August 2020. In her parting interview, she insisted no US scientists worked in Ukrainian biolabs and accused Russia of spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d about the program.  Kirillov pointed to mass outbreaks of avian flu in Russia and the EU in 2021, causing billions in damages, while the Kharkov Institute of Veterinary Medicine was studying wild birds as transmission vectors and assessing conditions under which the spread could cause economic damage and food insecurity. Evidence now shows the institute collected strains of avian flu capable of jumping species, Kirillov said, calling for an international investigation into the matter.

Four cases of dirofilariasis were detected in February that year, which is not typical for mosquito life cycles, the general said. Pentagon representatives visited the local hospitals in April, collecting medical records and getting briefed on the epidemiological investigation.

So far, the only agreement the sides have reached is to open humanitarian corridors.  There is no alternative to the Russia-Ukraine talks being held in Belarus, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has stated following talks with his Ukrainian counterpart in Turkey. \"\"Today's conversation confirmed that [the Belarusian] track [for negotiations] has no alternatives\"\", Lavrov said. He noted that the issue of negotiating a ceasefire was not on the agenda of his talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba today. The foreign minister stated that Moscow supports any contacts that are aimed at ending the current crisis in Ukraine. He added that these contacts must have \"\"added value\"\" for Moscow to agree to them. \"\"We act based on the premise that these contacts will not be used to replace or devalue the real main negotiating track that is developing on Belarusian territory \u2013 something that our colleagues, mostly Ukrainian, do routinely\"\", Lavrov said. Lavrov noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin never says \"\"no\"\" to contacts, as long as these meetings are not held \"\"for the sake of meetings themselves\"\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier offered Putin to meet personally to discuss the Russian special operation in Ukraine, which he and his Western allies call an \"\"invasion\"\". The Kremlin has not yet confirmed that such talks are being organised, but the issue was raised during Lavrov's talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba in Turkey on 10 March. The Russian foreign minister further stated that Moscow wants Ukraine to remain neutral and is ready to discuss security guarantees related to it \u2013 for Ukraine, European countries, and Russia itself. Lavrov added that Moscow wishes to see Ukraine as a friendly country that does not issue bans on Russian language and culture. President Vladimir Putin on 24 February ordered Russian troops to launch a special operation in Ukraine with the goal to demilitarise and de-Nazify the country. Putin said that Moscow was left with no other choice amid Kiev's failure to implement the Minsk agreements, continuing attacks on Donbass, and threats to withdraw from the Budapest Memorandum, which assured Ukraine's status as non-nuclear state.  Russia Outraged by US Activities at Biolabs in Ukraine  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia was \"\"outraged\"\" by the experiments that the Pentagon conducted at bio laboratories in Ukraine. He said that American money was used to experiment on dangerous pathogens that could potentially be used in biological weapons. \"\"Of course, the Americans carried out their activities in deep secrecy. Just like they work in other states in the post-Soviet expanse, creating their military biological laboratories right along the borders of the Russian Federation, as well as China\"\", he said. Lavrov said that Russia currently does not have any information regarding the use of biological weapons by Ukraine, but insisted that the experiments conducted in the US-funded biolabs were not benign and were aimed at the creation of prohibited biological weapons, including \"\"ethnically-oriented\"\" ones. The Russian Defence Ministry earlier published copies of the documents seized by the nation's military, which indicated that personnel in several Ukrainian laboratories were instructed to destroy the samples of dangerous pathogens amid fears that these biolabs would be seized by Russian troops. The ministry added that these laboratories were funded by the US and that they conducted experiments on such pathogens as African swine fever, anthrax, and bat coronavirus \u2013 the presumed ancestor of the COVID-19 virus.

With a high degree of probability, we can say that one of the tasks of the United States and its allies is the creation of bioagents that can selectively affect various ethnic groups of the population\"\", said Igor Kirillov, the head of the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces. Kirillov said that 350 cryocontainers with blood serum samples were transferred from the Public Health Centre of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to a reference laboratory for infectious diseases at Australia's Doherty Institute under the pretext of determining antibody titers. The Russian Defence Ministry has obtained documents confirming that the high-risk biological research in Ukraine is led by US specialists. According to Kirillov, the documents also showed that the US Defence Department funded the biological research in Ukraine. He also said that Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland \"\"indirectly\"\" confirmed American participation in the Ukrainian biological research when she said that Washington was concerned about the Ukrainian biolabs being taken over by the Russians. The biological research funded by the US in Ukraine, according to Kirillov, included the projects \"\"UP-2, UP-9, UP-10, aimed at studying the pathogens of anthrax and African swine fever\"\".

The documents showed that since 2017, such studies had been carried out by a secret US laboratory at the Richard Lugar Centre for Public Health Research in the Georgian capital Tbilisi. At the same time, it also turned out that the contractor company for the US Department of Defence (DOD) had studied bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, China, for several years (until March 2020), when the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was being carried out within the framework of a five-year programme called \"\"Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence\"\". The programme was financed by the DOD's Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and implemented by the New York-headquartered non-profit company Eco Health Alliance. According to the documents, the total amount of funding allocated for the implementation of the programme stood at about $10.2 million, of which $6.5 million went to Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Jordan. Some $3.7 million was earmarked for research in China.  US-Funded Biolabs in Ukraine  This comes as Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman Igor Konashenkov announced that the US-funded biological labs in Ukraine were conducting experiments with bat coronavirus samples. He told a news briefing that \"\"the American side planned to conduct work on pathogens of birds, bats, and reptiles in Ukraine in 2022, with a further transition to studying the possibility of carrying African swine fever and anthrax\"\".

US officials and media initially dismissed these revelations as \"\"Russian disinformation,\"\" but were forced to correct the narrative after undersecretary of state Nuland admitted that such labs do in fact exist.  The Russian Ministry of Defence has released fresh details about the US military-funded biolabs operating in Ukraine, including a trove of original documentation. The MoD also revealed that Joanna Wintrol, the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency's liason officer at the US Embassy in Kiev, has been serving as one of the programme's curators. Commenting on a trove of papers released in a presentation Thursday, Russian Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops chief Igor Kirillov pointed to a document dated 6 March 2015 which he said confirmed in no uncertain terms that components of biological weapons were being created in Ukraine with direct US involvement and financing. \"\"An analysis of the information received suggests that Ukrainian specialists have not been made aware of the potential risks involved in the transfer of biomaterials, and that they are essentially being used and kept in the dark, and have no real idea about the true goals of the ongoing research,\"\" Kirillov said at a briefing in Moscow.  Kirillov shed light on a major project worth tens of millions of dollars and involving Ukraine's top biolabs. The research, known as Project UP-8, was \"\"directed at the study of pathogens of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, leptospirosis and hantaviruses,\"\" according to the RCB Defence Troops chief. It is \"\"no coincidence\"\" that Ukraine-based facilities were chosen by the DTRA and contractor Black & Veatch to execute the project, the officer said, given that these pathogens have natural foci in both Ukraine and Russia.  \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot \"\"Their use can be disguised as the natural outbreak of diseases. This is why this particular project received additional funding, and the deadlines for its implementation were extended,\"\" Kirillov said. The MoD calculated that labs in Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Kharkov received $32 million in funding for Project UP-8.  Project P-782  Ukrainian biolaboratories were also the main executor of Project P-782, conducting research into the transmission of diseases through bats. A Russian RCB Defence Troops analysis of documents showed that Pentagon research has been going on since at least 2009 under the direct supervision of US specialists, and that work in this area has also been done through several related projects, known as P-382, P-444 and P-568. Kirillov said the Pentagon invested $1.6 million into this research, which was said to have been carried out at a lab in Kharkov, northeastern Ukraine, and the Lugar Center in Tbilisi, Georgia. \"\"One of the curators of this activity was DRA Chief Joanna Wintrol. Perhaps she should speak to journalists?\"\" Kirillov suggested. \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot The officer said that documents showed that the Pentagon began bat pathogen-related research in October 2019, on the eve of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot  Project Flu-Fly-Way  The officer also addressed information gleaned from documents received from the Kharkov Institute of Veterinary Medicine on the use of wild migratory birds as vectors for the transmission of a highly pathogenic form of avian influenza. This research, he said, included a study of the conditions under which the processes of the virus's transmission could become uncontrollable, with the purpose being to cause economic damage and creating risks to food security. \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot The same Kharkov lab, he said, has been involved with the collection of strains of avian influenza with high epidemic potential, including strains capable of overcoming the interspecies barrier. Kirillov also reported that the MoD has information that Ukraine's biolabs are continuing to destroy biomaterials and documentation on their research into dangerous viruses, in accordance with instructions sent out last month by Ukraine's minister of health. \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot \"\"We continue to receive information about attempts to destroy biomaterials and documentatation in Ukraine's laboratories. We are aware that during such liquidation activities at the Laboratory of Veterinary Medicine in the settlement of Khlebodarskoye [Odessa region] Ukrainian nationals working at the lab were not even allowed in the building,\"\" the officer said. \"\"This laboratory cooperates with the Mechnikov Anti-Plague Research Institute in Odessa, which conducts research on plague, anthrax, cholera, tularemia and arboviruses,\"\" Kirillov said. The emergency destruction of documents has also taken place in a lab in the city of Kherson. In that case, Kirillov speculated, \"\"one of the reasons for the rush may have been to conceal information about the outbreak of dirofilariasis, a disease transmitted by mosquitos, which took place in Kherson in 2018.\"\" \"\"The question arises about why four cases of infection were detected in February, which is not typical given the life cycle of these insects. In April 2018, Pentagon representatives visited local health facilities, where they were acquainted with the results of an epidemiological investigation and copied medical records,\"\" the officer said. No documentary evidence regarding the outbreak has been found in the Kherson lab, suggesting it had been scrubbed to prevent it from falling into the hands of Russian specialists, Kirillov said. \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot  Serum Express  Kirillov also expanded on previously-made MoD allegations on the sending of serum samples of Ukrainian patients abroad, citing documentation on the transfer of 5,000 samples to the Lugar Center, and indications that 773 more samples were sent to a UK reference lab. The MoD released a sample invoice. \u00a9 screenshot Document Document \u00a9 screenshot  Implications  Commenting on the security implications of the US-funded Ukrainian biolabs' operations for the region, Kirillov said that the 2018 deaths of over 70 residents of the settlement of Peski, Donetsk People's Republic from drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis may be associated with the activities of one such lab, with pathogens either accidentally or deliberately leaked. The officer accused the United States and Ukraine of keeping silent about the research taking place at Ukrainian biolabs from the United Nations, notwithstanding Biological Weapons Convention rules requiring member countries to submit detailed information on their biological activities. \"\"I'm referring here to the confidence-building measures, which are published with the aim of monitoring the implementation of the Convention. Since 2016, the moment that the projects we've named began to be realized...the United States and Ukraine have deliberately kept silent about this work in international reporting, due to its clear military-biological direction. This secrecy is another reason to stop and think about the goals the Pentagon is pursuing in Ukraine,\"\" Kirillov suggested. The officer suggested that essentially, Washington's farming out of its military biological activities to third countries serves a means to bypass its international obligations by proxy. The current activity is also nothing new, Kirillov stressed, pointing, for example, to President Barack Obama's surprise admission in 2010 that the United States deliberately infected Guatemalan nationals with syphilis and gonorrhea pathogens in the 1940s. The Russian military began to disclose details on the scale and scope of the US-funded network of biolabs across Ukraine last week. US officials and media immediately dismissed the MoD's reporting as Russian propaganda and disinformation, releasing articles and fact checks to that effect. These same officials and media were put on the spot on 7 March when undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland told lawmakers that \"\"biological research facilities\"\" were in fact operating in Ukraine. Nuland said the United States was \"\"quite concerned\"\" that Russian troops may take control of these labs, and assured that Washington was \"\"working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach.\"\" The Russian MoD has continued to provide additional information regarding the operations of these facilities in the days that followed.

Earlier, a draft resolution was submitted to the State Duma, which presented a list of lawmakers who could be included in the commission to probe the activities of the US labs in Ukraine. It reports support for the initiative to create the commission, as well as an appeal to the Federation Council with a proposal to create the commission. The annex to the resolution names 14 lawmakers, including commission chair Irina Yarovaya. \"\"We will definitely join this commission. We discussed this issue,\"\" Karasin said. The Russian Defense Ministry earlier held a presentation, according to which it was noted that the United States spent over $200 million on biological laboratories in Ukraine, which participated in the American military biological program. Russia, in light of the US military biological activities in Ukraine, does not exclude the launch of a consultation mechanism under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), according to the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova. Also adding to the ongoing commentary on information about US-funded biological laboratories in Ukraine, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lizqian urged Washington to clarify its biological militarization activities at home and abroad. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov also said that what has now been revealed in Ukraine is only a small fraction of more than 300 US biological laboratories scattered around the world, and added that Moscow will provide new documents on their work. The Russian Defense Ministry announced on March 7 that Russian military forces had discovered 30 biological facilities in Ukraine that are or were under the supervision of the US Department of Defense, which could be involved in the production of dangerous and illegal chemical weapons under the Geneva Convention. On March 8, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate that the US was working with Ukraine to preserve biological laboratories there because the Russian military \"\"may be seeking to gain control\"\" of them during Russia's special military operation. Izumi Nakamitsu, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, said last week that the UN lacked both the mandate and the technical capability to probe the Russia's reports of biological weapons programs in Ukraine.

US officials and media initially denied that the labs existed, but a senior Biden administration official later confirmed their presence.  An investment firm connected to US President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has been implicated in the financing of the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine, the head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops has announced, citing fresh documents. \"\"Incoming materials have allowed us to trace the scheme of interaction between US government bodies and Ukraine's biolabs. The involvement in the financing of these activities by structures close to the current US leadership, in particular the Rosemont Seneca investment fund managed by Hunter Biden, draws attention to itself,\"\" RCBD Troops chief Igor Kirillov said in a briefing Thursday. According to the MoD's information, the fund has at least $2.4 billion in investment capital. \"\"At the same time, a close relationship has been established between the the fund and key contractors of the US military, including Metabiota, which alongside Black & Veatch is one of the main suppliers of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world,\"\" Kirillov added. The Los Alamos National Laboratory - birthplace of the US atomic bomb, has served as one of the chief curators of the US military biological programmes in Ukraine, Kirillov said. \u00a9 Photo : Russian Defence Ministry Russian Defence Ministry presentation detailing coordination between Ukraine-based labs and US agencies and companies, including Hunter Biden and George Soros (far left), the US State Department, USAID, Gilead Sciences, SkyMount Medical, Metabiota, Black&Veatch, CH2M Hill, the US Embassy in Ukraine (center) and the CDC, the National Laboratory at Los Alamos and the universities of Tennessee, Alaska, Florida, New Mexico and Virginia (right).

The officer suggested that such practices were nothing new, recalling that in 2010, authorities in Indonesia terminated biological research activity being conducted by the US Naval Medical Center in Jakarta over numerous violations and a refusal by US authorities to inform the Indonesian government about the results of their research. Kirillov also revealed that Pentagon-affiliated pharmaceutical firm Gilead has been involved in the testing of its products in Ukraine and Georgia. \u00a9 Photo : Russian Ministry of Defence Document.

The officer pointed to the taking of blood samples from 4,000 servicemen in Lvov, Kharkov, Odessa and Kiev for antibodies to hantaviruses under Project UP-8, and an additional 400 samples probing for antibodies to the Crimean-Congo fever virus. He added that in addition to tissue and blood serum samples, dangerous pathogens and their carriers were exported abroad from Ukraine. Over 10,000 samples were sent to the Lugar Center in Georgia alone, according to Kirillov, with labs in the UK and the Leffler Institute in Germany also serving as recipients, subjecting not only Ukraine but the entire region to dangers.  New COVID  Kirillov warned that the spread of pathogenic biomaterials in Ukraine could lead to a new pandemic, saying that in the Russian military's view, \"\"the current situation involving the spread of pathogenic biomaterials from Ukraine to European countries can cause death and create a hotbed of epidemiological instability the scale of which would be comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\" The officer pointed to the Pentagon's record of causing health scares involving deadly pathogens, recalling that betwen 2005 and 2015, live anthrax spores were accidentally sent from the US Army Dugway Proving Ground to 194 addressees in ten different countries.  Anthrax Insects  Krillov also pointed to suspected US interest in the means of transmitting anthrax through insects. \"\"The interest of US military biologists in the study of insect vectors in the locations of cattle burial grounds appears not have been accidental, with researchers analyzing the results of an outbreak of anthrax in Yamal in 2016, during which cases of transmission of the disease through flies and horseflies were recorded,\"\" he said. \u00a9 Photo : Russian Defence Ministry Document.

China Demands Answers From US Over Russian Revelations About Military Biolabs in Ukraine 8 March, 13:09 GMT Thursday's revelations by the MoD follow a separate document dump last week containing frightening details on some of the research feared engaged in at US-funded laboratories scattered across Ukraine, such as work studying the transmission of diseases through bats, 'Project Flu-Fly-Way', studying how wild migratory birds might be used as vectors to transmit avian influenza, and others. The Russian military started disclosing details on the scale and scope of the US-funded network of biolabs in Ukraine on 6 March, reporting, citing documents, that the Ukrainian health ministry had given the order to scrub incriminating evidence on research into deadly pathogens including anthrax, the plague, tularemia, cholera and other deadly diseases. US officials and media dismissed the Russian allegations, releasing \"\"fact check\"\" pieces explaining that the \"\"false claim of US biolabs in Ukraine [is] tied to [a] Russian disinformation campaign.\"\" These same officials and outlets were forced to change their tune after US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland confirmed that the biolabs existed, and that the US was \"\"quite concerned\"\" that Russian troops might take control of the facilities.", "publication_date": "2022-03-24"}, {"headline": "Russia to Demand Explanation Over Hunter Biden's Links to Biolabs in Ukraine, Kremlin Says", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/20220325/russia-to-demand-explanation-over-hunter-bidens-links-to-biolabs-in-ukraine-kremlin-says-1094181208.html", "content": "The Russian presidential spokesman also referred to US speculations about the so-called \"\"Russian chemical weapons\"\" threat as an attempt to divert attention amid the scandal with US biological laboratories in Ukraine and other countires.

Hunter Biden\u2019s correspondence with Pentagon defense contractor Metabiota revealed how the son of then vice president leveraged his influence as a board member of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma to funnel money into pandemic-causing pathogen research just a few hundred miles from the Russian border. The emails were found on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop that he abandoned at a Delaware repair shop as his father was running for president in 2019, the New York Post said. The UK\u2019s Daily Mail was first to report on his role in bankrolling pathogen research.  The media said that Hunter and his partners funneled $500,000 to Metabiota through their Rosemont Seneca investment fund and helped raise millions of dollars more through investment firms, including Goldman Sachs.

He also reportedly bragged to investors that he helped Metabiota find new customers among government agencies. US government spending records show that Washington awarded $23.9 million to Metabiota later in 2014, including some $307,000 allocated for Ukrainian research projects, The New York Post said.  Russia had been trying to get access to biological laboratories in Ukraine and Georgia through international institutions, but was denied the premission, the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.  What did they tell us? ...Visit laboratories? Of course. Stay in the reception area, there are wonderful people there who will meet you, get you some coffee and show you the catalogs.

There are more than 300 US-funded biological laboratories across the world, Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, has stated.  \u201cThere are areas where there is a high concentration of US [bio] laboratories, both military and civilian ones. When the slide was being prepared, there were more than 200 [such biolabs], and today the figure stands at over 300\u201d, Popova said at the annual All-Russian Congress on Infectious Diseases named after Academician Valentin Pokrovsky on Monday.  She also noted that countries are building more such facilities against the background of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The remarks followed Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov saying last week that Russian experts had revealed new facts pointing to the direct involvement of the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the development of biological weapon components in Ukraine. The main goal of this project was to conduct a molecular analysis of especially dangerous infections endemic to Ukraine, according to Konashenkov. He added that it was also revealed that a pharmaceutical company contracted by the Pentagon worked with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry to develop tests of unregistered medicines on Ukrainian military personnel. The remarks came after Igor Kirillov, the head of radiation, chemical, and biological defence of the Russian Armed Forces, said earlier this month that the total amount of US funding for military biological work carried out in the laboratories of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence amounted to $32 million.  \u201cI draw your attention to the fact that an agreement on joint biological activities was concluded between the US military department and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. However, the real recipient of the funds are the laboratories of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, located in Kiev, Odessa, Lvov and Kharkov\u201d, Kirillov told reporters.  In a separate development, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Russia will demand explanations about the involvement of the son of US President Joe Biden, Hunter, in financing biological laboratories in Ukraine that were tracked by Russian forces in the course of their ongoing special military operation in the country.

The MoD has published correspondence between the US President\u2019s son and employees of the US Department of Defense Threat Reduction Office, as well as Pentagon contractors in Ukraine. The emails suggest that Hunter Biden was instrumental in raising funds for the American contractors, Black & Veatch and Metabiota, enabling the companies to engage in pathogen studies on the territory of Ukraine, stated the head of the Russian radiation, chemical and biological defense forces, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov. 'Limited Hangout': Will Western Media Finally Look Into Hunter Biden Biolabs-Funding Story? 27 March, 13:54 GMT It also follows from the correspondence that the goals of the Pentagon in Ukraine are far from scientific, underscored the Russian Defense Ministry. Igor Kirillov recalled that earlier, in the course of Russia\u2019s special operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine, the military had seized documents that revealed an ongoing scheme of interaction between US government agencies, the current military-political leadership of the United States with Ukrainian biolabs.

One of these was Robert Pope, at the time Director of the US Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at DTRA, which had sought to draw post-Soviet states into biological warfare, stated Major General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, at Thursday's briefing. Pope spearheaded the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bcreating a \"\"Central Depository of Especially Dangerous Microorganisms in Kiev,\"\" the general added.

According to him, Black & Veatch has been working in the interests of the Pentagon since 2008 as an inherent part of projects studying potentially dangerous bioagents. Among these was the UP-1 project to study rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus in arthropods in northwestern Ukraine. In the course of the UP-2 project, the company introduced a system for remote monitoring of the incidence of tularemia and anthrax at Ukrainian biological facilities, said the Russian general, adding: \"\"Issues of biomonitoring and transfer of information were supervised by David Mustra, who is closely associated with another Pentagon contractor, Metabiota. Previously, he led military bio-projects in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program,\"\" said the Russian Defence Ministry spokesman. The MoD then revealed that Ukrainian engine maker Motor Sich asked the manufacturers of Turkish Bayraktar drones about the possibility of using the UAVs to spray deadly substances, which raises concerns in the light of the American military biological programme developed in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov stressed that the document on this request is dated 15 December 2021, with Motor Sich wondering if it's possible to equip Bayraktar drones with systems and mechanisms for spraying aerosols with a capacity of more than 20 liters. He emphasised that such a UAV with a flight range of 300 kilometers could pose a real threat of contamination of the territory of Russia. \"\"In fact, we are talking about the development by the Kiev regime of technical means for the delivery and use of biological weapons with the possibility of their use against the Russian Federation,\"\" Kirillov concluded. Russia's MoD has previously shed light on the fact that the US spent more than $200 million on the work of biological laboratories in Ukraine, which were a part of the American military biological programme and dealt, in particular, with plague and anthrax pathogens. The freshly-provided damning correspondence comes as the Russian military has spent weeks shedding light on research into deadly pathogens being conducted in Ukrainian laboratories under the direction of the Pentagon and with US funding. Initially, the MoD's reporting was dismissed by Washington as \"\"Russian disinformation\"\", with both officials and media since then corroborating many of the assertions.

One question, asked by Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from the state of Florida, stood out. \u201cDoes Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?\u201d he asked.  Nuland answered the question very deliberately. \u201cUkraine has biological research facilities which, in fact, we\u2019re now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of, so we are working with the Ukrainians on how we can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach,\u201d she said.

The purpose of Rubio\u2019s question wasn\u2019t to pin Nuland into a corner, but rather set up the follow-on question, designed to deflect a very discomforting issue into a propaganda opportunity for the US government.  \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware,\u201d Rubio said, \u201cthat the Russian propaganda groups are already putting out there all kinds of information about how they have uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to unleash biological weapons in the country, and with NATO\u2019s coordination.\u201d The senator paused before asking his question. \u201cIf there is a biological or chemical weapon incident or attack inside Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians behind it?\u201d  Nuland answered this question with more authority: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind, Senator. And, in fact, it is a classic Russian technique to blame the other guy for what they are planning to do themselves.\u201d  Rubio was right about one thing \u2013 the Russians were having a field day about the \u201cbiological research facilities\u201d Nuland was so reticent about discussing. Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced that \u201cWe [Russia] confirm that, during the special military operation in Ukraine, the Kiev regime was found to have been concealing traces of a military biological program implemented with funding from the United States Department of Defense.\u201d  According to Zakharova, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, on February 24 \u2013 the first day of the Russian offensive \u2013 had ordered all the Ukrainian biological laboratories to \u201curgently\u201d eradicate the stored reserves of \u201c highly hazardous pathogens of plague, anthrax, rabbit fever, cholera and other lethal diseases.\u201d She said the documentation on the \u201c urgent eradication \u201d of the pathogens was \u201creceived from employees of Ukrainian laboratories.\u201d  While noting that more work was being done by the Russian Ministry of Defense to fully assess the documents in question, Zakharova said Russia was able to conclude \u201cthat components of biological weapons were being developed in Ukrainian laboratories in direct proximity to Russian territory.\u201d  \u201cThe urgent eradication of highly hazardous pathogens on February 24 was ordered to prevent exposing a violation of Article I of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) by Ukraine and the United States,\u201d she added.  Read more US responds to Russian bioweapons claims  Article I of the BTWC states that \u201cEach State Party to this Convention undertakes never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile, or otherwise acquire or retain:  microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes; weapons, equipment or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict.\"\"  Earlier, the US Embassy in Kiev published information relating to what it described as a \u201cBiological Threat Reduction Program,\u201d a collaboration between the US Department of Defense and the Ukrainian government. According to this data, \u201cThe [biological threat reduction] program accomplishes its bio-threat reduction mission through development of a bio-risk management culture; international research partnerships; and partner capacity for enhanced bio-security, bio-safety, and bio-surveillance measures.\u201d According to the US Embassy, \u201cthe Biological Threat Reduction Program\u2019s priorities in Ukraine are to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern and to continue to ensure Ukraine can detect and report outbreaks caused by dangerous pathogens before they pose security or stability threats.\u201d  This all sounds innocuous enough and, if true, seems to meet the criterion set forth in Article 1 of the BTWC regarding \u201cprophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes.\u201d  There is suspicion, however, that the Defense Threat Reduction Agency-led biological programs may have a more nefarious purpose. The Bulgarian investigative journalist, Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, has conducted extensive research into this issue. \u201cThe US Army regularly produces deadly viruses, bacteria and toxins in direct violation of the UN Convention on the prohibition of Biological Weapons. Hundreds of thousands of unwitting people are systematically exposed to dangerous pathogens and other incurable diseases. Bio-warfare scientists using diplomatic cover test man-made viruses at Pentagon bio laboratories in 25 countries across the world,\u201d she claimed.  Gaytandzhieva\u2019s work has been dismissed by the US as \u2018pro-Russian propaganda.\u2019 But the inescapable fact is that the US does not have a clean record when it comes to compliance with the BTWC. So-called \u201cbio-defense\u201d has been used by the US to circumvent, if not outright violate, the provisions of the BTWC in the past. The most flagrant example of this was the CIA-led \u201cProject Clear Vision, \u201d which from 1997 until 2000 sought to reverse-engineer and subsequently test a Soviet-era \u201cbomblet\u201d designed to disperse biological agents, including anthrax. There was a debate within the Clinton administration as to whether \u201cClear Vision\u201d violated the BTWC, which led to the program being halted in 2000.  Read more Lee Camp: America\u2019s impressive history of bioweapons attacks against its own people  There is no need to worry about any such malfeasance at the biolabs in Ukraine, however, the director of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Robert Pope, recently told reporters. \u201cWhat we have today\u2026 are small amounts of various pathogens that by and large are things that are collected out of their environment that they need for research to be able to legitimately surveil disease and develop vaccines against.\u201d  According to Pope, the Ukrainians had \u201cmore pathogens in more places than we recommend,\u201d adding that his organization had been helping Ukrainian researchers organize their frozen pathogen collections with an eye on preserving genetic information via sequencing before destroying the live samples. \u201cAll of that, obviously, has been derailed here with the recent events,\u201d he said.  Pope\u2019s biggest concern was that if these biolabs lost electrical power for any extended time, then the frozen samples would thaw out. \u201cIf the ventilation system is damaged, or the building itself is damaged, and these now ambient-temperature pathogens are able to escape the facility, then they can be potentially infectious in the region around the facility,\u201d he said.  He expressed hope that the facilities would not be deliberately attacked. \u201cI think the Russians know enough about the kinds of pathogens that are stored in biological research laboratories that I don\u2019t think they would deliberately target a laboratory. But what I do have concerns about is that they would\u2026 be accidentally damaged during this Russian invasion.\u201d  While Pope had been painting a relatively benign picture of the types of pathogens stored at the facilities he supervised, he left a clue about the potential for something far more worrisome. While noting that many of the biolabs in Ukraine were of new construction, \u201cothers date back to the Soviet-era and the country\u2019s bioweapons program. \u201d Some of these older laboratories, Pope said, could hold pathogen strains dating back to the Soviet biowarfare programs. \u201cScientists being scientists, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if some of these strain collections in some of these laboratories still have pathogen strains that go all the way back to the origins of that program.\u201d  If this is the case, then the Ukrainian labs could very well be the repository of Anthrax 836, an extremely deadly strain of that disease specifically developed to be delivered in warheads mounted on SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles operating from Ukraine.  Read more US comments on Ukrainian \u2018biolabs\u2019  This, it would seem, would put the labs in direct violation of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which prohibits the acquisition or retention of pathogens \u201cthat have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes.\u201d  Anthrax 836, and other similar Soviet-era biological weapons, no longer exist. As such, there is no need to conduct research designed to defend from any potential exposure to such agents. The only possible explanation for retention of Soviet-era biological warfare pathogens would be to keep them for some future biological warfare program, or as a source for covert operations seeking to falsely link a target nation, such as Russia, to illegal activity.

China Demands Answers From US Over Russian Revelations About Military Biolabs in Ukraine 8 March, 13:09 GMT According to Konashenkov, these facilities were developing components for biological weapons. \u201cWith the start of a special military operation, the Pentagon had serious concerns about disclosing the conduct of secret biological experiments on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cTo prevent disclosure of the facts of violation by the United States and Ukraine of Article 1 of the UN Convention on the Prohibition of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons by The Ukrainian Ministry of Health, instructions of urgent elimination of stored stocks of dangerous pathogens was sent to all biolaboratories,\u201d Konashenkov said. In the near future, the ministry will release its analysis of the received documents. Controversy has long surrounded all \u201cbiological facilities\u201d of this type that were established in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with rumors alleging that Pentagon-funded experiments have been carried out on local military forces to examine resistance to dangerous diseases.

The diplomat recalled that Russia's operation in Ukraine had started urgently. If the Ukrainian health ministry sent relevant instructions to biolaboratories throughout the country on the day the operation started, it means that an emergency plan had been put into action. She added that the laboratories that were supposed to destroy the materials they worked with in case of an emergency were US facilities conducting bioweapon experiments.  \"\"This completely changes the picture of US involvement in the fate of Ukraine: it is not just an instrument of influence, it is not just an instrument of deterrence, it is an instrument of a direct threat to our country,\"\" Zakharova said on air in an interview with Sputnik Radio, which started broadcasting on a new frequency on Wednesday.  If the activities of biolaboratories in Ukraine hadn't been stopped, their development would have gotten out of control, the official added. On 7 March, the Russian Armed Forces discovered 30 biological laboratories in Ukraine, which were possibly involved in biological weapons production, according to the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence of the Russian Armed Forces Igor Kirillov. The Russian defence ministry made public a presentation, which said that the United States spent more than $200 million on the work of biological laboratories in Ukraine, the laboratories of the central sanitary and epidemiological directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry participated in the US military biological programme. After the Russian military statement US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland confirmed that Ukraine hosts \"\"biological research facilities\"\" and the United States was concerned that they could come under the control of the Russian forces. On Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that China urged the United States to \"\"fully clarify its biological militarisation activities at home and abroad\"\".", "publication_date": "2022-03-09"}, {"headline": "US Tried to Fund Biolabs in Ukraine as Early as 2005, Records Show", "url": "https://sputniknews.com/20220311/us-tried-to-fund-bio-labs-in-ukraine-as-early-as-2005-records-show-1093786051.html", "content": "Moscow has unveiled evidence that Kiev ordered several bio laboratories, which received US funding, to destroy samples of dangerous pathogens.

The US government has been dodging questions for some time about the fact that it funded biolabs in Ukraine, until Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted on 8 March that Washington did provide assistance to these laboratories (but still avoided confirming accusations by Russia that Kiev developed biological weapons there). It is not clear what took the US so long \u2013 especially since it knew perfectly well about at least one such lab for more than a decade.

It was specifically designed to research these pathogens, the article said citing the late senator. \"\"The continuing cooperation of Nunn-Lugar partners has improved safety for all people against weapons of mass destruction and potential terrorist use, in addition to advancements in the prevention of pandemics and public health consequences\"\", Lugar said at the time. Moreover, talks about establishing the ICRL in Ukraine date back even further \u2013 to 2005, according to an archived Nunn-Lugar Report edition from August of that year. Back then, Lugar and (at that time) fellow Senator Barack Obama were coordinating efforts with Ukrainian authorities to study and help to prevent the spread of avian flu. Coincidentally, avian flu was one of the pathogens that Kiev's laboratories were studying in the context of the potential spread of dangerous pathogens via bird migration from Ukraine to Russia, Russian Defence Ministry findings suggested. \u00a9 Photo : Nunn-Lugar Report Screenshot of archived Nunn-Lugar Report from August 2005 Screenshot of archived Nunn-Lugar Report from August 2005 \u00a9 Photo : Nunn-Lugar Report Eventually, Ukraine signed an agreement with the US under the Nunn\u2013Lugar Act, which sought to remove weapons of mass destruction from the former Soviet states, and agreed to the construction of a modern laboratory for handling and studying dangerous pathogens on its territory. Despite eventually admitting the presence of the US-funded bio laboratories in Ukraine, Victoria Nuland did not consider Russia's accusations about experiments on modifying dangerous pathogens and turning them into biological weapons. At the same time, she said Washington was \"\"quite concerned\"\" with the prospect of the Russian military seizing these laboratories during their special operation on Ukrainian territory. CIA Director William Burns claimed that Ukraine conducts no research on dangerous pathogens that could be used in biological weapons. He dismissed the Russian military's statements as \"\"propaganda\"\" and a possible pretext for \"\"false flag operations\"\". The World Health Organisation, in turn, called on Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens housed in its laboratories \u2013 citing the need to prevent \"\"accidental or deliberate release\"\".

Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defence discovered 30 biolabs in Ukraine and released documents indicating collaboration between Kiev and the Pentagon on studying highly dangerous pathogens.  \"\"The US State Department says that the public mission of the biolabs in Ukraine is about securing Cold War era Soviet bioweapons\"\", says former Pentagon analyst and retired US Air Force Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski. \"\"The companies that operate and have constructed these labs competed far more recently for contracts awarded by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), so the Cold war or Soviet era weapons disposal rings hollow.

US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland speaks at a press briefing at the State Department in Washington, DC, on January 11, 2022. \u00a9 NICHOLAS KAMM On the same day, the National Pulse, a US-British conservative media outlet, recovered a deleted article titled \"\"Biolab Opens in Ukraine\"\", dating back to 18 June 2010. The article said that the US had built a level-3 biosafety lab in the Ukrainian city of Odessa to study dangerous pathogens, including anthrax, tularemia, and Q fever, \"\"used by bioterrorists\"\". A 2011 report from the US National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Committee on Anticipating Biosecurity Challenges of the Global Expansion of High-Containment Biological Laboratories, also cited by the National Pulse, further reveals that the Odessa lab was reconstructed through \"\"a cooperative agreement\"\" between the Pentagon and the Ministry of Health of Ukraine that started in 2005 \u2013 following the US-backed 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine \u2013 and served as \"\"Interim Central Reference Laboratory with a depozitarium (pathogen collection)\"\". A separate document, cited by the media outlet, named the pathogens the facility allegedly conducted research on, including: the Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, Junin, Machupo, and Simian B viruses, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, as well as other viruses of pathogenicity group II. Earlier this week, Fox News host Tucker Carlson raised a red flag over the lack of transparency about the Ukrainian biolabs' research of dangerous pathogens and the US government's role in it. The host quoted Robert Pope, the head of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at the Pentagon, who claimed in a 25 February interview that some Ukrainian biolabs may hold pathogen strains left over from the Soviet bioweapons programme preserved in freezers for research purposes. According to Carlson, this sounds bizarre, given US mainstream media claims that since 2005, the Pentagon has been busy with \"\"eliminat[ing] biological weapons left behind by the Soviets\"\" in Ukraine.  \"\"White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki then denounced the reports as 'false' and 'preposterous' and described them as 'the kind of disinformation operation we\u2019ve seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years' - as if the US never engaged in disinformation operations of its own\"\", says independent journalist, author, and writer Daniel Lazare. \"\"Needless to say, such rhetoric did nothing to reduce suspicions, but raised them all the more\"\".  \u00a9 Photo : Russian Ministry of Defence Screengrab of Russian Defence Ministry briefing showing US-sponsored biolabs on Ukraininan territory.

The US Defence Threat Reduction Agency played the leading role in financing and developing components for biological weapons, according to the Russian MoD. In particular, Project UP-4, conducted with the participation of laboratories in Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa, studied the possibility of the spread of dangerous infections through migrating birds; Project R-781reportedly studied bats as carriers of viral pathogens, including plague, leptospirosis, brucellosis, coronaviruses, and filoviruses that can be transmitted to humans, thus making them \"\"potential biological weapons agents\"\", according to the MoD. Among the goals pursued in the Ukrainian biolabs was the creation of bioagents that would be capable of targeting certain ethnic groups, the Defence Ministry stated. On 6 March, the Russian MoD released Ukrainian Ministry of Health documents containing instructions to all biological laboratories to urgently eliminate stored stocks of dangerous pathogens amid Russia's special operation. \u00a9 REUTERS / Jason Reed An aerial view of the Pentagon building in Washington, June 15, 2005 An aerial view of the Pentagon building in Washington, June 15, 2005 \u00a9 REUTERS / Jason Reed Judging from the incoming reports, it appears that the US carried out bio warfare programmes in Ukraine in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 (BWATA), according to Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, who drafted BWATA and has been fighting against the spread of bioweapons since 1983.  \"\"These bio warfare labs in Ukraine are offensive biological warfare weapons labs that have been set up by the Pentagon to research, develop, test biological weapons\"\", says Boyle. \"\"Yes, that is true. This is what is going on\u2026 It violates the BWC and all American citizens who were involved in any of these biological warfare labs in Ukraine violated my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that provides for life in prison. And if you take a look at these biological warfare labs, they have surrounded Russia in different countries there with these offensive biological warfare weapons labs. They have nothing to do with scientific research. This is run by the Pentagon. The Pentagon is interested in warfare and killing people, it's that simple\"\".  All bioweapons centres in Ukraine have to be secured and decontaminated by Russian professional experts on biological weapons and then rendered permanently inoperable so that they can never be used again for any reason, according to the professor. Boyle noted that American neoconservatives, an influential political group Victoria Nuland is tied with, had long flirted with the idea of biological warfare weapons which could target specific genotypes and be used as a \"\"politically useful tool\"\". According to Boyle, the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), a US major neocon think tank, openly discussed that in their manifesto\"\"Rebuilding America's Defenses\"\" (2000), cited by the academic in his book \"\"Biowarfare and Terrorism\"\" (2005).  \"\"There is no moral or national security justification for this kind of project\"\", says former CIA analyst Larry Johnson, while commenting on the suspected US biowarfare programme in Ukraine. \"\"This now explains, at least to me, why the United States was so insistent on provoking this war with Russia. Covering up a bioweapons program is almost impossible. My country is proving to be an international outlaw\"\".  Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Ukraine's apparent desire to create a nuclear weapon constitutes a severe threat to Russia, President Vladimir Putin has said. \"\"Statements were made by Kiev authorities about their intention to create nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. This was a real threat. Already in the foreseeable future, with foreign technical assistance, the pro-Nazi regime in Kiev could get its hands on weapons of mass destruction. And the targets of such weapons would of course be Russia,\"\" Putin said at a briefing devoted to the economy on Wednesday. Russia also faces other WMD-related threats from Ukraine, Putin said. \"\"A network of dozens of laboratories operated in Ukraine under the direction of and with financial support from the Pentagon. Miltiary biological programmes were carried out there, including experiments with samples of the coronavirus, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other deadly diseases,\"\" he noted. \"\"They are now trying to sweep up the traces of these secret programmes. But we have every reason to believe that in the immediate vicinity of Russia, in Ukraine, components of biological weapons were effectively being created,\"\" Putin said. Russia's UN Envoy Calls on EU to Consider Real Threat of Biological Agents Spreading From Ukraine 11 March, 16:47 GMT Putin suggested that just like Moscow's concerns about Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO, Russia's \"\"repeated warnings that such a development of events poses a direct threat to Russia's security were rejected by Ukraine and their patrons from the US and NATO, and with theatrical and cynical disdain.\"\" \"\"Thus, all diplomatic possibilities were completely exhausted. We were simply left with no options to peacefully resolve problems which arose through no fault of our own. We were simply forced to launch the special military operation,\"\" Putin said.  No Occupation  The Russian president reiterated that the troops deployed in Ukraine were not there to \"\"occupy\"\" Ukraine. \"\"As far as the tactics of military operations -which were developed by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the General Staff is concerned, it has vindicated itself completely,\"\" he said. \"\"Our guys, our soldiers and officers are showing courage and heroism. They're doing everything in their power to avoid losses among the civilian population of Ukrainian cities,\"\" Putin said. Putin also revealed that ahead of the operation, through various channels of communications, Moscow had communicated to Kiev the proposal that Ukraine remove its forces from the Donbass. \"\"They didn't want to do this. This was their decision. But the realization of what is taking place in the real world on the ground will inevitably come,\"\" he said. Putin said the military operation in Ukraine was going according to plan, and that it would continue until all the goals which have been set are achieved. \"\"We will reliably secure the security of Russia and its people and will never allow Ukraine to serve as a springboard for aggressive actions against our country,\"\" he said. Ukraine's government, Putin said, was planning for a military solution to the conflict in the Donbass, including the ethnic cleansing of the civilian population. \"\"A massed assault on the Donbass, followed by Crimea was only a matter of time, and our armed forces frustrated these plans.\"\" Situation in Ukraine No Plans for Offensive on Donbass? Docs Show 48% Boost in Kiev's Defence Industry Output in 2022 11 March, 10:45 GMT \"\"Kiev was not only planning to start a war, for aggression against Russia and the Donbass, but was already carrying it out. Attempts to organize sabotage and a terrorist underground in Crimea did not stop. All through the last years military operations continued in the Donbass, including the shelling of civilian settlements. During this time nearly 14,000 civilians died, among them children. On 14 March as you know, a rocket strike was carried out in the city of Donetsk. This was a blatant, bloody terrorist act which claimed the lives of over 20 people. And such shelling has continued throughout the past days,\"\" Putin said. Western media made no mention of this crime, the president added.  Sanctions: War by Other Means  Putin characterized Western countries' reaction to Russia's military operation in Ukraine as a war by \"\"economic, political and informational means,\"\" and said sanctions targetting the country have affected not only ordinary Russians, but the entire global economy. \"\"Western leaders themselves are already revealing that the sanctions are not directed against individuals or companies. Their goal is to strike at our entire economy, its social and humanitarian spheres, at every family, every citizen of Russia. Factually, such steps aimed at worsening the lives of millions of people have all the signs of aggression,\"\" Putin said.  \"\"For the West, our military operation in Ukraine is just an excuse for more sanctions...It's just a matter of pretexts. But the policy of containment, of the weakening of Russia, including with the help of economic isolation and blockades - this is the main, long-term strategy,\"\" Putin said.  While they've harmed Russia, the West's sanctions have also had a boomerang effect on those who implemented them, according to Putin. \"\"A serious blow has been dealt to the entire global economy and to trade, to confidence in the US dollar as the main reserve currency,\"\" he said. Accusing the West of accelerating a \"\"spiral of global inflation\"\" through its actions, Putin suggested that this will lead to a rise in global poverty and an increase in refugees. The US and Europe are already facing rising prices for food, energy, and the loss of jobs associated with the Russian market, he noted.  \"\"I want ordinary people in Western countries to hear me too. An effort is being made to convince you that all your difficulties are the result of some kind of hostile actions by Russia, that you have to pay for the fight against the mythical Russian threat through your wallet. All of this is a lie,\"\" Putin said. \"\"The truth is that the current problems that millions of people in the West face are the result of many years of actions by the ruling elites of their states, their mistakes, myopia and ambitions,\"\" he said.  \"\"These elites are not thinking about how to improve the lives of their citizens. They are obsessed with their own selfish interests and surplus profits,\"\" Putin said. \"\"The myth of the Western welfare society, of the so-called 'Golden Billion' is collapsing. Today, the entire planet has to pay the price for the ambitions of the West, its attempts by any means to maintain its elusive dominance.\"\" Pointing to the arrest of the assets of Russian companies and tycoons abroad, Putin suggested that it was a good \"\"lesson\"\" for them \"\"that there is nothing more reliable than investing in your own country.\"\" Commenting on Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov's recent admission that Western countries had frozen about $300 billion of Russia's gold and foreign exchange reserves, Putin suggested that this constituted a default on the West's financial obligations to Russia. \"\"Illegitimate actions to freeze part of the Russian Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves underlines the 'reliability' of these so-called first-class assets,\"\" he said. Investors Increasingly Fear US Recession as Federal Reserve Poised to Hike Interest Rates 15 March, 23:45 GMT  Nuclear Ambitions, Biolabs  The Russian military and Ukrainian and US officials themselves have made a series of revelations in recent weeks about the extent of Kiev's suspected preparations to take Donbass by force, and efforts to build weapons of mass destruction on Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hinted in a speech at the Munich Security Council in February that Kiev may renounce its commitment not to build nuclear weapons. Earlier this month, a source familiar with the nuclear sector told Sputnik that the United States may have supplied Ukraine with plutonium suitable for nuclear weapons development, and that recent clashes between Russian national guard units and Ukrainian saboteurs in administrative buildings adjacent to the Zaporizhia NPP may have been related to a nuclear weapons programme. Last week, the Russian MoD published documents purporting to show Ukrainian preparations for an assault on the Donbass. Separately, the military released evidence on the extent of a Pentagon-backed biowarfare programme being operated in Ukraine. US officials and media initially dismissed these reports as Russian propaganda and disinformation, but US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland confirmed that Ukraine is hosting what she dubbed \"\"biological research facilities,\"\" and said Washington was \"\"quite concerned\"\" that the \"\"research materials\"\" there could fall into Russian hands. According to the Russian military, these biofacilities engaged in dangerous research akin to something out of a Tom Clancy novel, including experiments with bat, reptile and bird coronaviruses, and the means to spread deadly pathogens via wild migratory birds. Furthermore, the Ukraine-based labs reportedly sent serum samples of primarily \"\"Slavic ethnicity\"\" patients to a key Pentagon biolab in Maryland, for reasons as yet unclear.

Washington initially denied the MoD's reporting as \"\"Russian disinformation\"\", but officials and media have since corroborated many of its assertions.  Ukrainian authorities seriously considered the possibility of using biological weapons against civilians in the Donbass and Russia, and the military will hold a special briefing on the matter, Russia's Ministry of Defence spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, has said.  \"\"The facts which have been unearthed demonstrate that the Kiev regime seriously considered the possibility of using biological weapons against civilians in the Donbass and in the Russian Federation,\"\" Konashenkov said in a briefing on Wednesday.  The spokesman said the Russian military is continuing its analysis of documents received from employees of Ukraine-based biological laboratories, including the secret military biological activities being conducted in the country by the US.  \"\"As a result of the analysis of new materials by experts from the Russian Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops, specific officials who were involved in the creation of components of biological weapons have been named. These include the heads of departments and employees at the US Defense Department, as well as its main contractor companies. As ongoing journalistic investigations in the western press show, these campaigns were directly connected to Hunter Biden, the son of the US president,\"\" Konashenkov said.  The MoD spokesman did not elaborate on when the new information would be made public. The Russian military has spent the past month slowly pulling back the curtain on the extent of US-funded research into dangerous pathogens in Ukraine-based labs. Last week, the MoD cited documents which implicated an investment firm connected to Hunter Biden in the financing of the military biological programme in Ukraine. Situation in Ukraine Covert Work on Deadly Pathogens: How US Military Biolabs Infiltrated Ukraine 25 March, 17:35 GMT Western media initially rejected the Russian reports, with British newspaper, The Daily Mail, accusing the MoD of \"\"ramping up a wild propaganda campaign\"\" on bioweapons labs. However, analysis by the newspaper based on emails garnered from the laptop which Biden Jr left behind in a Delaware computer repair shop soon confirmed that the president's son \"\"DID (sic) help secure millions in funding for [a] US contractor in Ukraine specialising in deadly pathogen research,\"\" and that the allegations made by Russia \"\"may well be true\"\". A report by the New York Post, the same newspaper that first broke the Biden laptop story in the autumn of 2020, corroborated the Daily Mail's reporting on Hunter and the Ukrainian biolabs. Pro-White House media has continued to defend the president amid mounting questions related to his family's activities in Ukraine, with the Washington Post releasing a \"\"fact check\"\" explainer suggesting that the labs alluded to were \"\"biological research facilities focused on better detecting, diagnosing and monitoring infectious-disease outbreaks,\"\" not \"\"bioweapons labs\"\". Furthermore, the Post suggested that \"\"random emails can be easily misinterpreted without additional reporting,\"\" and claimed, without evidence, that reports by its competitors were false. Other outlets and media organisations, including the Daily Beast, NPR and Media Matters for America, have continued to dismiss the Russian MoD releases and western outlets' reporting as \"\"crazy\"\" \"\"conspiracy theories,\"\" notwithstanding Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland's remarks in a Senate hearing earlier this month confirming that \"\"biological research facilities\"\" were operating in Ukraine, and that the US was \"\"quite concerned\"\" that \"\"Russian troops...may be seeking to gain control of\"\" the facilities and the \"\"research materials\"\" contained therein.

There is no need to mention again that we are having this meeting at a difficult time. The international situation has reached its boiling point. In fact, we are witnessing the climax of a policy to contain Russia, pursued by the West for a long time now in order to weaken our positions, to try to reassert a unipolar world (as they are now admitting almost openly), demanding everyone to obey the \u201crules\u201d developed by Western countries. The United States is playing a critical role in advancing these policies and philosophies. This is clear to everyone.  The support provided by Washington and Brussels (NATO and the EU) to the Kiev regime in order to turn it into a tool for containing Russia and everything that is Russian came as the high point of their Russophobic policies. All these years, Ukraine has consistently been passing laws banning the use of the Russian language in education, the media, and even in everyday life. That way, all Russian roots and the common history of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples were ripped out in Ukraine.  In recent years, Ukraine has been flooded with weapons, drawn into NATO, and nudged towards a forceful solution of the Donbass issue. The Kiev leadership was encouraged to sabotage the Minsk Package of Measures for the peaceful settlement of the crisis in eastern Ukraine even despite the fact that this document is part of international law and was approved by a UN Security Council resolution.  While the Ukrainian leadership was evading its obligations under the Minsk agreements, the nationalists were destroying civilian facilities, schools and hospitals in Donbass. Everyone knows that. These facts, including the killing of civilians, were regularly depicted by our media, but hushed up in the West. Over 10,000 civilians are dead. No one in the West paid attention to the inhuman economic, trade, transport and food blockade of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk people\u2019s republics.  Kiev\u2019s unconcealed plans to acquire nuclear capability caused our concern. The military biological programmes implemented by the Pentagon in Ukraine and the creation of almost 30 laboratories came to our attention. We raised this issue at the UN Security Council. This is not a one-time act, and this topic will remain in the focus because it is directly related to risks and threats to international peace and security. It is in this vein that we will be asking questions about non-transparent military-biological activities around the globe.  We are particularly concerned about the geopolitical space of the former USSR, where the American military and the Pentagon are establishing military bio-laboratories. Even the host countries of these US facilities do not always know what kind of research they are making there.  President of Russia Vladimir Putin explained in detail that in this situation we had no choice. An onslaught was waged against us from all sides to impede our development and create a direct threat at our borders. Furthermore, Ukraine officially announced that it would never fulfil the Minsk agreements. We had no choice but to recognize the DPR and the LPR and to launch a special military operation at their requests and based on our mutual assistance treaties with them. This operation is aimed at protecting people and their lives from the danger of the war, at demilitarising and de-Nazifying Ukraine. We had to make sure that the threats to Russia\u2019s security and the rebirth of Nazi and neo-Nazi ideology and practice, banned by the Nuremberg Trials, would never come from the territory of Ukraine.  Today, a total hybrid war was declared against us. Hitler\u2019s Germany used this term. Now it is mentioned by many European politicians when they describe what they want to do with the Russian Federation. They do not hide their goals but declare them in public: to break, destroy, eliminate and stifle the Russian economy and Russia as a whole.  When we see this no-holds-barred sanctions campaign, we understand that nothing stands behind the \u201cvalues\u201d that our Western colleagues have continuously preached at us: freedom of expression, a market economy, the inviolability of private ownership or the presumption of innocence. As soon as the West had to do something practical as regards Russia, it easily abandoned all these values.  Regardless of these efforts, isolating Russia is out of the question (although precisely this goal was set). Nor are we going to self-isolate. We have many friends, allies and partners in the world. Russia works with many countries on all continents within many associations. We will continue to do so.  Propaganda juggles the voting numbers for provocative resolutions in the UN. However, the overwhelming majority of states outside the historical collective West do not want to play a lopsided game. They are subjected to enormous pressure, but they should not be guided by the provocative texts of propaganda that the West plays with at the UN; they need to be guided by the real status of trade and economic ties. The overwhelming majority of states has not joined (and, I\u2019m convinced, will not join) the West\u2019s sanctions game. These states are interested in developing equitable interstate cooperation based on the key principles of the UN Charter, primarily the sovereign equality of states. The West is crudely trampling this underfoot and imposing its \u201csupremacy\u201d on all countries. The history of Russia and Europe has witnessed such attempts to subdue everyone and everything. They are doomed to fail.  Colleagues,  It is necessary to take into account the current geopolitical environment in the work of the Fund. Emphasis should be laid on promoting cooperation with the organisations in the countries that have remained immune to anti-Russian hysteria. They account for the overwhelming majority of the international community (over 80 percent of the world\u2019s population). The newest challenges and threats (cyberspace and the persisting risk of war) should remain on the Fund\u2019s agenda.", "publication_date": "2022-03-25"}, {"headline": "US comments on Ukrainian \u2018biolabs\u2019", "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/551510-nuland-ukraine-biolabs-attack/", "content": "Washington confirms it is working with Kiev to prevent Russia from accessing the laboratories  US Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland has confirmed that Washington has been involved in an effort to make sure no \u201cmaterials\u201d Ukraine keeps in its biolabs end up with the Russian military.  \u201cUkraine has biological research facilities, which, in fact, we are now quite concerned\u2026 Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of,\u201d Nuland said on Tuesday as she testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  \u201cWe\u2019re working with Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach,\u201d she added.

Metabiota and Black & Veatch are known as major supplies of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world, the MoD specifies. \u00a9 Photo : Russian Defence Ministry Russian Defence Ministry presentation detailing coordination between Ukraine-based labs and US agencies and companies, including Hunter Biden and George Soros (far left), the US State Department, USAID, Gilead Sciences, SkyMount Medical, Metabiota, Black&Veatch, CH2M Hill, the US Embassy in Ukraine (center) and the CDC, the National Laboratory at Los Alamos and the universities of Tennessee, Alaska, Florida, New Mexico and Virginia (right).

The former Pentagon analyst notes that judging from surveys, 90% of US mainstream media personalities, reporters, and publishers are politically Democrats, which makes it almost impossible that they would attack the Democratic administration and key politicians. \"\"I think it will be suppressed and access to many overseas new organisations is already being blocked by Google, Facebook, and Twitter\"\", she says. Yet, the Daily Mail \u2013 a media outlet belonging to Australian-born US media mogul Rupert Murdoch \u2013 reported on 25 March that the Russian MoD's findings are \"\"at least partially true\"\". According to the media outlet, the emails from Hunter's laptop \"\"show he helped secure millions of dollars of funding\"\" for Metabiota, a Department of Defence contractor which worked in Ukraine, specialising in research on pandemic-causing diseases \"\"that could be used as bioweapons\"\". Per the media outlet, Hunter Biden and his business partners invested $500,000 in Metabiota through their firm Rosemont Seneca and raised several million dollars in funding for the company from investment giants including Goldman Sachs. The Daily Mail also quotes US government spending records indicating that the Pentagon awarded a $18.4 million contract to Metabiota between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 earmarked for \"\"Ukraine research projects\"\". Hunter Biden\u2019s Investment Fund Connected to Financing of Pentagon-Funded Biolabs in Ukraine: MoD 24 March, 12:24 GMT  Pentagon Has Good Reason to Keep Silent  Former senior CIA officer Sam Faddis, cited by the Daily Mail, notes that even though the Pentagon insists that that there's nothing nefarious occurring in Ukraine and the biolabs are simply focused on pandemic early warning research, \"\"we don't know for sure that's all that was going on\"\". The Pentagon has good reason to conceal the truth as it could have potentially violated the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act (BWATA) of 1989, according to Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law who drafted the law in question.  \"\"There's no alternative for them but to lie because under my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act they all face life imprisonment for setting up these laboratories and funding them in Ukraine\"\", Boyle says. \"\"Under my law the punishment is life imprisonment for any US citizen or resident to get involved in research, testing defence, stockpiling biological weapons anywhere in the world\"\".  Boyle expresses scepticism about the possibility of the Pentagon being held accountable. He recalled that he was the first one to blow the whistle that the anthrax attacks of October 2001 came out of the US Biological Warfare Weapons Lab and programme. \"\"I did that at a conference at Harvard Divinity School on November 1, 2001, and I gave a couple of interviews and an order was given\"\", he says. \"\"And I was never interviewed again by any Western news media source, and the United States government is still lying about the origins of that attack. And they've covered up and they've gotten away with it\"\". \u00a9 REUTERS / CARLO ALLEGRI Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia votes during a United Nations Security Council meeting, on a resolution regarding Russia's actions toward Ukraine, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2022.

They started with the destruction of Yugoslavia years ago. Then they moved on to the September 11th, collapse of the World Trade towers, all three buildings, into their own footprint. Then they moved on to covering up American aggression in Afghanistan, and in Iraq and Libya and Syria\"\".  Now Washington may try to shift the focus by calling for international peacekeepers to enter Ukraine, according to Springmann. \"\"That would divert attention and then paint the Russians again as aggressors who won't let poor, innocent peacekeepers into the country to ensure that Ukraine will do what the American government wants it to do\"\", he suggests. Situation in Ukraine NATO Being Persuaded to Deploy Troops in Western Ukraine & This is Insanity, US Military Expert Says 25 March, 11:27 GMT Meanwhile, one shouldn't delude oneself into believing that the United Nations \u2013 which has repeatedly declined to investigate the issue of the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine \u2013 would step forward and call for a new inquiry, according to the observers. \"\"The United Nations is under the control of the United States\"\", says Springmann. \"\"Its headquarters sits in New York City and the United States supplies a good chunk of the UN's budget, and it has a great control over its membership by promising aid or withholding aid or benefits or other things that might be useful to a foreign country\"\".  \"\"The independent, international, and private communications of millions of people do pick up on more objective news, and people of all political persuasions simply do not want to be associated with biological warfare or pentagon bio-labs\"\", Karen Kwiatkowski says. \"\"This undertow of concern about biological warfare specifically will continue to grow, and gain attention, until several years from now, The Washington Post, New York Times, and CNN-ABC-NBC-CBS will finally report it\"\",  Let's stay in touch no matter what!

And they are really negatively affecting the lives of ordinary Russians, even though Washington is saying that it\u2019s not targeting Russians. What can you say about what the goals of these sanctions are and who the target really is?  Sergey Lavrov: I believe the goal of the sanctions is much more strategic than just Ukraine. I think what we witness in Ukraine is the quintessence of the western course, strategic course to marginalise Russia, to contain Russia, to stop Russia\u2019s development and to reduce Russia to a zero role in world politics and world economy, world trade, world sports, art, science, education. And we observe unprecedented steps our Western colleagues are taking. One of the underlying trends is the United States\u2019 desire \u2013 which has been much more manifested by the Biden administration \u2013 to come back to a unipolar world. And, if you wish, they are trying to take the melting pot concept from the United States soil and make a melting pot from the entire world, and they would be the smelters. The European Union already, I think 99 percent, stopped trying to be independent. President Macron, of course, keeps repeating that strategic autonomy for the European Union is his goal and he would be fighting for it, but my guess is that he would not succeed. Germany is already absolutely ready to obey instructions from the United State. The situation with North Stream 2 clearly indicated what exact place in world politics Germany occupies now, when the Americans in fact have \u201cpersuaded\u201d the Germans and others that they, the Americans, know much better what Europe needs for its energy security than Europeans themselves. And there are many examples like this. So the sanctions drive is going to continue, they are threatening the fifth wave, maybe there would be another wave, but we\u2019re used to it. I will recall that, long before the Ukrainian crisis erupted because of the illegal anti-constitutional coup d\u2019etat, the sanctions were already imposed on us. It was, you know, when the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment was repealed, the Magnitsky Act was immediately introduced and the sanctions, in one way or another, stayed. And then there was a series of sanctions, as you mentioned, to punish us, basically, for supporting the legitimate cause of Russians in Ukraine, Russians in Crimea, you know this story, I wouldn\u2019t rehearse the events and the sequence of events.  The latest sanctions wave was really unprecedented and, as President Putin recalled, we are now champions in the number of sanctions introduced against the Russian Federation \u2013 more than 5,000 individual acts, almost twice as many as was introduced against Iran and North Korea. But sanctions, or all of this, made us stronger. After the sanctions were announced in 2014, when the West could not accept the free vote of Crimeans to rejoin the Russian Federation, when the West basically supported the illegitimate and unconstitutional coup d\u2019etat. You know what was very interesting to me when I talked about those events to my Western colleagues? They very often use the tactic of cutting off an unwanted historical period. The situation in Ukraine they start discussing only with what they call annexation of Crimea. If you remind them that it all started with the European Union being unable to insist on the implementation of the deal, which they guaranteed, by the opposition, and then the opposition just threw away the deal signed and guaranteed by the European Union, and then the leaders of the opposition and of the so-called Maidan, the radicals, like Dmitry Yarosh were saying \u201cWe stand for a Ukraine without Russkis and katsaps\u201d (which means Muscovites), and he publicly stated that if the Russians \u2013 well, he said the Russians in Crimea would never think Ukrainian, would never speak Ukrainian, would never glorify the heroes, meaning Bandera and Shukhevich and other collaborators of Hitler \u2013 and that\u2019s why Russians must be swiped out of Crimea. Actually, this was said a couple of weeks before the Crimeans eventually decided to go to referendum. And these words were accompanied by deeds. They sent armed groups to take control of the Crimean parliament, and that\u2019s how it all started. Not to mention the initiative \u2013 immediately, on the first day of this coup d\u2019etat, the putschists introduced an initiative to do away with the status of the Russian language in Ukraine, which was in the Ukrainian Constitution. So all these instincts were immediately translated into very Russophobic policies.  The idea that Russians should get out of Ukraine is still very much on the minds of politicians in this country. Oleg Tyagnibok, the leader of the ultra-radical party, Svoboda (\u201cFreedom\u201d), has repeatedly said that \u201cwe must have de-Russification\u201d, as he calls it. And de-Russification means that ethnic Russians must not have their own language, history and identity in Ukraine and so many similar things. But what is more important for us to understand in the current state of play are these statements by Zelensky himself. So I said that the ultra-radicals called for Russians to be wiped out of Crimea, and President Zelensky, in September last year, said, if you believe you\u2019re a Russian, if you believe you want to be a Russian and if you want to be friendly with Russia, go to Russia. He said this just a few months ago.  So, coming back to sanctions: sanctions we will survive. The measures which the president and the government are developing, elaborating, are being announced. This is only the beginning of our economy getting adjusted to the new situation. After 2014, as I started to say, we did gain experience to rely upon ourselves. And the biggest lesson from this particular historical period is, unlike what we saw after 2014, that now, if there was any illusion that we can one day rely on our Western partners, this illusion is no longer there. We will have to rely only on ourselves and on our allies who would stay with us. This is the main conclusion for Russia in the context of geopolitics.  Question: I think it\u2019s safe to say that Russian culture specifically has become accustomed to being part of, you might say, a global village of countries that share deep economic ties and enjoy travelling between each other. How do you think these sanctions are going to influence the everyday life of Russians in the long term in relation to that?  Sergey Lavrov: Well, as I said, the assessment of what is going on, in my view, clearly indicates that what America wants is a unipolar world, which would be not like a global village, which would be like an American village and maybe American saloon where who is strongest is calling the shots. And they said they are succeeding to mobilize behind themselves and, on the basis of their own interests, the entire Western world, which is indicative of how independent NATO members and European Union members are and which is indicative of what place the European Union, as I said, would have in the future configuration of the world situation and the world system.  There are players who would never accept the global village under the American sheriff, and China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico \u2013 I am sure these countries do not want to be just in the position where Uncle Sam orders them something and they say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d And of course, Russia is not in the category of countries who would be ready to do so. Actually, when people say \u2013 when the Americans and Western Europeans and others say that Russia was defeated in the General Assembly because the vast majority of countries voted against the Russian action in Ukraine, it\u2019s misleading because, if you take the population represented by the countries who were not voting against Russia, and especially if you take the number of countries who introduce sanctions against Russia, a majority of those who voted against us did so under huge pressure, under blackmail, including \u2013 I know this for sure \u2013 including threats to individual delegates regarding their assets in the United States, bank accounts, children studying in universities and so on and so forth. It\u2019s absolutely unprecedented blackmail and pressure without any scruples. So a majority of those countries who voted with the West, they did not and they would not introduce sanctions against Russia. They believe that it\u2019s, you know, not a very big price to pay for their own practical cooperation with Russia, just to vote on something which is needed for the West for entirely propagandistic purposes. So we will be, as always, open to cooperation with anyone who is ready to do so on the equal basis, on the basis of mutual respect and searching for balance of interests, and the countries to the east of Russia are much more disposed to act on this basis, and we will certainly reciprocate for the benefit of both us and our partners. We are not closing the door on the West. They are doing so. But when they come back to their senses and when this door is reopened, we will be looking at proposed projects of cooperation with a very important thing in mind to which I alluded to already \u2013 that we will be going into cooperation with them knowing very well that we cannot be sure that they are reliable and that they are credible as long-term partners.  Question: Well, I\u2019d like to take the discussion now to a sort of different topic: these US-sponsored biolabs in Ukraine. I mean, for years already, Russia has been trying to bring the world\u2019s attention to them. And the latest piece of evidence connected to them the Russian military just put forward not too long ago, with documents signed by US officials in connection to them. Why do you think is the world not paying so much attention to these biolabs? And will Washington and its allies be held accountable for what they\u2019re doing there?  Sergey Lavrov: Actually, it\u2019s interesting that the special military operation launched by the president of the Russian Federation helped discover many things which are very important for understanding what is going on. Recently, the military of Russia, together with Donetsk and Lugansk forces, discovered documents of the Ukrainian general staff indicating clearly that they were preparing a massive attack against the Donetsk and Lugansk republics. So the operation, which was launched by Russia, in fact, preempted this threat and did not allow them to implement what they wanted to do, and they wanted to do exactly what they failed to do implementing the Minsk agreements. They were trying to use what they called Plan B and to take these territories by force with bloodshed on an unbelievable scale, in addition to what they have been doing to civilians for the last eight years.  But another set of documents which was discovered \u2013 as you said, documents related to military biological activity of the United States in Ukraine \u2013 documents with signatures of Ukrainian officials, US military. Those laboratories have been created by the United States all over the world. More than 300 laboratories in various countries, many of them on the perimeter of the Russian Federation \u2013 in the former Soviet republics, including Ukraine. Ukraine is probably the biggest project for the Pentagon, who is running this show. The special Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the Pentagon is in charge of this biological activity, and they are developing very dangerous pathogens, including plague, brucellosis, anthrax and many others, which are really very dangerous. And we know that they were experimenting on potential infections, which could be related to the ethnic groups living in the east of Ukraine and in neighboring regions of Russia.  We have been raising this issue in international organizations for a while, I would say almost more than 20 years. In 2001, we suggested that the countries participating in the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons should develop a verification mechanism which would be transparent, which would be understood by everybody and applied to everybody because the convention itself provides for consultations if any participating state has some suspicions or some information which the state would like to clarify. And if these consultations indicate that there is a good reason for some kind of investigation, then an investigation is supposed to be launched. But there is no mechanism to investigate, and there is no mechanism which would require each and every country, in response to an address, to provide information and to guarantee transparency of its biological activity anywhere, be it on your own territory or abroad.  By the way, the Americans some years ago decided that it is too dangerous to do these things on their own soil. So they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries, and more and more they concentrate their research and experiments around the borders of the Russian Federation and China. So we will be insisting on this issue to be picked up by the Biological Weapons Convention, but also by the Security Council, because it\u2019s a clear threat to international peace and security. We will be again emphasising the importance of negotiating a legally binding protocol to the Convention on Biological Weapons, which would require obligatory transparency measures by any participating state. The Americans, I have no slightest doubt, would be against it, but this position of theirs is not defendable. I am convinced that more and more countries understand how dangerous these plans are, and we will continue to fight them.  Question: What can you say on the topic of Washington\u2019s role in all of this? President Zelensky called for weapons to come to his country from the West. He\u2019s talked about a demand for establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and this is something that Joe Biden just recently again said is not going to happen because that would lead, no doubt, to outright war between Russia and NATO and the United States. Why do you think is Ukraine so desperately trying to make some sort of scenario like that happen?  Sergey Lavrov: Whatever you think of some of Joe Biden\u2019s statements, he is a very experienced politician and he understands that it is absolutely inadmissible to establish something like a no-fly zone, to provide planes to Ukraine and to do other things which will bring the risk of direct confrontation between NATO and Russia just, you know, immediately. But Zelensky also understands that there are much less responsible politicians in the United States who are being agitated by the Ukrainian lobby and just driven by Russophobic feelings, and many of them are in Congress. They adopt every now and then resolutions condemning Russia, threatening Russia. I believe Zelensky is counting on them pushing the president in the direction of a more confrontational approach.  We clearly said that any cargo moving into Ukrainian territory which we would believe is carrying weapons would be fair game. This is clear because we are implementing the operation the goal of which is to remove any threat to the Russian Federation coming from Ukrainian soil. This was part of our proposal in December last year when we suggested that we negotiate with NATO security guarantees \u2013 the way which would be codifying the old agreement reached at the highest level that no one, no country should increase its security at the expense of the security of others. So they know what it is all about.  They also speak about missile defense. Kiev authorities think of asking NATO members who possess Soviet air defense systems to share this with them.  I would like to remind the countries who might be playing with this idea that the Soviet and Russian-made systems of missile defense or of any other purpose are there on the basis of intergovernmental agreements and contracts, which includes an end user certificate. The end user certificate does not allow them to send these weapons to any third country without our consent. This is a legal obligation. I understand that legality and legal obligations is not something which our Western colleagues respect these days. They\u2019ve already thrown away the presumption of innocence, private property being sacred and many other \u201cpillars\u201d on which the \u201cliberal values\u201d have been resting for so many centuries and decades.  But this is a serious matter, and I can assure you that we would not allow these risks to be materialised. The purpose of our operation is to protect civilians, who have been bombed and shelled and murdered for eight years, and to demilitarise Ukraine so that it does not pose a serious threat to the Russian territory, and to find security guarantees, which would be based on this equal, indivisible security principle for Ukraine, for Russia, for all European countries. We have been proposing this for many years. Denazification is an absolute must. And that includes not only canceling laws encouraging Nazist ideology and practices, but it also includes withdrawing any legislation which discriminates the Russian language and other national minority languages and, in general, national minority rights in Ukraine which have been hugely discriminated and offended.  Question: Well, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the kinetic war, but I wanted to ask another question about the information war actually. A few days ago, the White House had a briefing with several popular TikTokers in the United States, and they were basically briefed on a new anti-Russian narrative that Washington wants to put forward. What do you think about such sort of underhanded propaganda technique when it\u2019s usually Russia that they\u2019re accusing of misinformation and underhanded tactics?  Sergey Lavrov: Well, we are a very, very small player in the international information war. It's the information\u2026 World information is dominated by media belonging to the Americans, the Brits, and also the Germans, the French and others. It's another matter, what the quality of those information outlets is. If you take CNN, they prefer to avoid analytical materials and they more and more concentrate on some reports which would be made of slogans \u201cRussia is an aggressor,\u201d \u201cRussia is murdering civilians,\u201d \u201cRussia is abusing sports\u201d and so on and so forth.  When they concentrate on TikTok and other resources like this and other platforms and when they target kids because TikTok is about young boys and girls, I believe this is an attempt to brainwash them for the rest of their lives. And this is indecent and not fair.  If you want information and competition, if you want competition among media outlets, then there at must be some rules.  I would remind you and your viewers that in 1990, when the Soviet Union was living under this \u201cnew thinking\u201d concept and the human values, common values for humankind, the Western colleagues in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe were pushing very actively, and finding support on the Soviet side, a series of documents of the OSCE on freedom of speech and on access to information. Such documents were endorsed by consensus in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. These days, when your channel and Sputnik many years ago were banned from attending, for example, press conferences and briefings in \u00c9lys\u00e9e in Paris, and when we were drawing the attention of the French colleagues that this was against the commitment in the OSCE, they were saying, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no. Access to information is applicable only to mass media and RT and Sputnik are not mass media, they are propaganda tools.\u201d  Another example of abusing the commitments and obligations \u2013 when a couple of years ago in London there was a conference on freedom of media in the modern world, no Russian media were invited.  So we know the manners and the tricks which are being used by the Western countries to manipulate media. We understood long ago that there was no such thing as an independent Western media. If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative points of view. But when you watch other channels and when you read social networks and internet platforms, when the acting president was blocked, as you know, and this censorship continues in a very big way and the substitution of notions. Whenever something is happening by the way of mass protest, mass demonstrations, which they don't like, they immediately call it domestic terrorism. So it's a war, and it's a war which involves the methods of information terrorism. There is no doubt about this.  A very interesting example was yesterday, when the Bild newspaper in Germany published a piece saying that myself on the evening of March 16 left Moscow by plane to go to China, but in the area of Novosibirsk, the plane turned back because either Putin told me to come back or the Chinese said, \u201cWe don't want to talk to you.\u201d It was published by, yes, a tabloid, but with millions of copies. And it's a shame that we have these habits being introduced into the information world by our \u201cfriends.\u201d It is not by incident that President Putin said about the existence of the Empire of Lies.  Question: Well, just one more question for you, Mr. Lavrov. Of course, this conflict in Ukraine is not going to go on forever. When it does come to an end, what do you foresee as the main challenges in future Russia\u2013Ukraine relations?  Sergey Lavrov: Well, we never had any issues with the Ukrainian people. I have many Ukrainian friends, the two peoples are very close culturally. Practically all of them speak, and those who don't, they understand the Russian language. Culture, common history, way of life, attitude to life, traditions of families and communities. So I hope that when this anomaly is over, this will gradually come back. It will have to be gradual.  It cannot come back fast because the efforts of our Western colleagues to make Ukraine a Russophobic and anti-Russian instrument \u2013 anti-Russia, as President Putin called it \u2013 they started long ago, and they are already rather deeply rooted in Ukrainian mentality, especially the young generation which was born after the demise of the Soviet Union. They have been indoctrinated in a very, very heavy way.  The efforts were taken systemically to train military officers on the basis of radical Bandera and Shukhevich-style methodology. The purpose being \u2013 to make sure that they would not become friendly to Russia again and that they would build their nationalism, nationalistic feelings as the means to strengthen the statehood of their country.  The purpose was always to make sure that Russia does not have Ukraine as a friend. It's like Zbigniew Brzezinski in the late 1990s said, \u201cRussia with Ukraine, a friendly Ukraine next to it, is a superpower. Russia with Ukraine which is not friendly to Russia, is just a regional player.\u201d This concept is very deeply rooted in the minds of American policymakers, and it will take time to get rid of these negative legacies.  Even now, when the armed forces of Ukraine are fighting, trying to procrastinate the crisis. The leaders of Ukraine with the help of American and other Western advisors have reformed the army in the way which puts these radicals, Bandera-like trained officers, to lead all more or less meaningful units in the Ukrainian army. And these people radicalise and terrorise others, especially those who don't believe that this should be the fate of their country.  Their actions in Mariupol is an example of that. The refugees coming from Mariupol to Russia in dozens of thousands tell such stories. It's really threatening how this kind of people command armed men and women.  But I am sure, at the end of the day, the historic closeness of two fraternal nations will certainly prevail.", "publication_date": "2022-03-18"}, {"headline": "Russia claims Ukraine destroying evidence of US-funded bioweapons program", "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/551374-ukraine-biological-warfare-labs/", "content": "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry says Kiev ordered scientists to destroy samples of plague, anthrax, and other lethal pathogens  As Russian troops entered Ukraine, the government in Kiev ordered the \u201cemergency destruction\u201d of pathogens including plague and anthrax at US-funded laboratories near the Russian border, the Ministry of Defense in Moscow claimed on Sunday.

The order to destroy the samples was an attempt to cover up the violations of the treaty, it said.  \u201cWe stand for the resumption of the work on a legally binding Protocol to the Convention for an effective verification mechanism, which the US has been stonewalling since 2001,\u201d the ministry said.  The BWC, which came into force in 1975, bans the development, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons. Unlike its counterpart for chemical weapons, the Convention for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the treaty lacks an international watchdog organization to verify compliance.  An attempt to establish such an organization took place in the 1990s. The VEREX ad hoc committee spent a decade formulating proposals for surveillance, inspections, information sharing and other confidence-building measures.  The effort ultimately failed due to objections from the George W Bush administration which, in 2001, rejected a 210-page draft protocol. Washington claimed that it would not have improved the BWC, if implemented, and would have hurt US national security and commercial interests.

The existence of Saddam Hussein\u2019s bioweapons project was \u201cbeyond dispute,\u201d he claimed at the time. Two years later the US invaded Iraq under the pretext that it needed to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false.  Russia has been voicing concerns for years over US military-funded labs hosted by some nations in its proximity, most notably Georgia. Moscow believes that Washington is conducting military research there that may pose a threat to Russia. The foreign ministry statement said activities held on foreign soil should be subjected to reporting under the BWC, just like domestic programs.  The proposed measures \u201cwould allow subjecting military-biological activities of the US and its allies \u2026 to international control and ensure full verifiable compliance with the BWC by member states,\u201d Moscow said.  Following Russia\u2019s claims about labs in Ukraine, China called on the Pentagon to publicly comment on bio research conducted in foreign nations with its funding.

He said the West had encouraged Ukraine to turn into an \u201canti-Russia,\u201d and now its leader is trying to goad US President Joe Biden into going to war for Kiev.  Lavrov argued that Moscow is being subjected to \u201cinfo-terrorism\u201d by its opponents, who have dropped all pretence of adhering to the values they preach. Tensions will calm down, but Russia will no longer be under any illusion that it would be welcomed as an equal in the West, the foreign minister added.  Here are some of the highlights from the interview  \u2018Just months ago, Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky told ethnic Russians to go to Russia\u2019 Western officials want to memory-hole the fact that the Ukraine crisis started with an armed coup in Kiev, Lavrov said. The post-coup authorities implemented discriminatory policies consistent with Russophobic views of radical Ukrainian nationalists, who were the fighting forces behind the Maidan protest, he added, and President Volodymyr Zelensky endorsed this stance too. Lavrov cited remarks made by Zelensky in August, in which he told people living in the breakaway region of Donbass to go to Russia if they considered themselves to be Russian. Moscow recognized the two rebel republics as sovereign states days before attacking Ukrainian troops. The foreign minister argued that it was one of many pieces of evidence suggesting Ukraine was being turned into an \u201canti-Russia,\u201d as President Vladimir Putin described it in late February. The West encouraged this process, Moscow believes. Lavrov stressed that Russia had no issue with the Ukrainian people. The goal of the military action is to deny any power to radical nationalists and force Kiev to scrap discriminatory legislation, he said.  Zelensky goading Biden into war Zelensky has been using his newfound status as a Western media darling to put pressure on the Biden administration to escalate tensions with Russia by establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine and providing it with advanced weapons. According to Lavrov, Biden is an experienced politician who realizes the dire consequences of such policies. \u201cBut there are much less responsible politicians in the United States, who are being agitated by the Ukrainian lobby and are just driven by Russophobic feelings. Many of them are in Congress,\u201d he said. Russia considers any weapons supply \u201cfair game\u201d for an attack, Lavrov warned.  US \u2018brainwashes\u2019 kids as it wages information war against Russia The foreign minister commented on the White House\u2019s recent move to brief popular TikTok influencers about how rising gas prices in the US were supposedly Russia\u2019s fault. Lavrov said the US government was apparently trying to \u201cbrainwash\u201d kids \u2013 the primary audience of the platform \u2013 calling this approach \u201cindecent.\u201d The global news landscape is dominated by Western outlets, Lavrov acknowledged, adding that they have been using their power to attack Russia. \u201cWe know the tricks that have been used by Western countries to manipulate the media. We understood long ago that there was no such thing as independent Western media,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a war [against Russia] that involved the methods of informational terrorism, there is doubt about this,\u201d Lavrov said. That was one of the reasons why Putin branded the US-led world order an \u201cempire of lies,\u201d he added.  US biolabs should be scrutinized The top Russian diplomat reiterated his call for US-funded biolabs located in other nations to be subjected to international scrutiny. Moscow fears that the research performed in these facilities may violate the Biological Weapons Convention. MOre than 300 such biolabs operate around the world, Lavrov claimed, pointing out that many of them are located close to the borders of Russia and China. \u201cThe Americans some years ago decided that it was too dangerous to do [such research] on their own soil. So, they moved all these threatening and dangerous activities to other countries,\u201d he said. The US says the sites funded by the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency simply monitor potentially dangerous infections. But last week US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland admitted that Washington was helping Ukraine to destroy research materials in the biolabs it hosts to prevent the Russian military from capturing them. Moscow wants the Convention to be reinforced with a protocol that would implement mandatory compliance verification mechanisms for all member states, including the US. Washington has long opposed such efforts, which Moscow and Beijing find suspicious.  \u2018We didn\u2019t shut the door, but no illusions remain about the West\u2019 Western hostility towards Russia is long entrenched, and the current escalation leaves Moscow with no illusion that it could have been accepted as an equal after the collapse of the USSR, Lavrov said. The US has gone to great lengths to demonstrate how the entire world is supposedly denouncing Russia for its attack on Ukraine and supports punishing it, the official said. He claimed that, in some cases, the Americans had threatened officials representing foreign nations in international organizations with personal sanctions to force them to vote against Russia. But the move to rally around the anti-Russian flag is far from universal, he said. \u201cThere are players who would never accept a global village under the American sheriff. China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico. I am sure those countries do not want to be in a position where Uncle Sam orders them to do something and they say \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that the same can be said about Russia. Moscow remains open to any nation willing to deal with it with mutual respect, including Western nations, Lavrov said. \u201cWe are not closing the door on the West, they are doing so. But when they come back to their senses, and when this door is reopened\u2026 we will be going into cooperation with them knowing very well that we cannot be sure that they are reliable,\u201d he explained.", "publication_date": "2022-03-18"}, {"headline": "Moscow wants US to comment on Hunter Biden\u2019s alleged link with Ukrainian biolabs", "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/552689-hunter-biden-ukraine-biolabs/", "content": "The US should come clean about the suspected involvement of President Joe Biden\u2019s son in shady research in Ukraine  Russia wants to hear comments from the US government on the alleged involvement of Hunter Biden into financing a network of biolabs in Ukraine, which Moscow suspects of conducting bioweapons research, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

Documentation obtained from laboratories in Ukraine on 24 February showed that dangerous pathogens - including anthrax, cholera, and the plague - had been destroyed in what could be a cover up of activities in violation of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, there were about 30 laboratories on the territory of Ukraine fulfilling orders from the US Department of Defence. The Russian military cited documents it had acquired, published on 9 March, which show that the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, Viktor Lyashko, ordered laboratories to eradicate pathogenic samples ahead of the introduction of martial law in the country. The Russian military also revealed that \"\"the available documents confirm numerous cases of the transfer of biological samples of Ukrainian citizens abroad\"\", which was seen as a possibility that the US was \"\" creating bioagents that can selectively affect various ethnic groups of the population\"\". As such, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health reportedly sent 350 cryocontainers with blood serum samples to Australia and around 1,000 to Germany. Let's stay in touch no matter what!

Russia's assertion that US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, helped finance a US military \"\"bioweapons\"\" research program in Ukraine seems to be legit, The Daily Mail reported on Friday. Citing the evidence from emails obtained from the notorious abandoned laptop of the president's son, the outlet reported that he helped secure millions of dollars of funding for Metabiota, a Department of Defense contractor specializing in research on pandemic-causing diseases that could be used as bioweapons. Biden also introduced Metabiota to an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, for a \"\"science project\"\" involving high biosecurity level labs in the Eastern European nation. According to the report, Metabiota is a medical data company, but its vice president wrote Hunter in 2014 to discuss how they could \"\"assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia,\"\" thus giving rise to speculation about the company's goals. Hunter may have reportedly played a key role in ensuring Metabiota was able to perform pathogen research close to the Russian border, according to emails and defense contracts obtained by the outlet. The younger Biden and his colleagues at Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), an investment firm he purportedly owned, consistently raised millions of dollars for technology companies, and Metabiota was not an exception. Hunter and his coworkers reportedly exchanged emails about how the company's medical data monitoring may become a crucial tool for governments and businesses attempting to spot infectious disease outbreaks. However, Hunter was also allegedly heavily involved in Metabiota's activities in Ukraine. Laptop, Ukraine & Biolabs: New Hunter Biden Scandals Threaten to Axe Joe's Possible 2024 Bid 25 March, 12:00 GMT In Hunter's April 2014 investor pitches, he reportedly stated that they not only helped the company receive financing, but also helped \"\"get new customers,\"\" including \"\"government agencies in the case of Metabiota.\"\" The company's vice president, Mary Guttieri, wrote a memo to Biden, outlining the unexplained goal of moving Ukraine closer to the West, according to the report. \"\"As promised, I've prepared the attached memo, which provides an overview of Metabiota, our engagement in Ukraine, and how we can potentially leverage our team, networks, and concepts to assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia and continued integration into Western society,\"\" she wrote. Guttieri also reportedly played a key role in Metabiota's Ukraine operations, meeting with other company executives and US and Ukrainian military officials in October 2016 to discuss \"\"cooperation in surveillance and prevention of especially dangerous infectious diseases, including zoonotic diseases in Ukraine and neighboring countries.\"\" According to the Daily Mail, Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi responded to Hunter four days after Guttieri's April 2014 email, indicating that the vice president's son had presented a \"\"science project\"\" involving Burisma, on whose board of directors he served, and Metabiota in Ukraine. Pozharskyi purportedly asked Biden to take a look at \"\"few initial points\"\" of the purposes to look into \"\"the potential of this as you called, 'Science Ukraine' project.\"\" \"\"As I understand the Metabiota was a subcontract to principal contactor of the DoD B&V [Black & Veatch],\"\" he is quoted in the report as writing in that email. \"\"What kind of partnership Metabiota is looking for in Ukraine? From potential non-governmental player in Kiev? Rebuilt the ties with respective ministries in Ukraine, and on the basis of that reinstate the financing from the B&V? Or they look for partnership in managing projects in Ukraine, PR with Government institutions here, financing of the projects?\"\" Pozharskyi claimed in an email to Hunter that B&V had worked on \"\"similar or the same projects\"\" as the proposed contract for Metabiota and that he had known several of such biological research projects in his previous role as a Ukrainian government official.

The Russian Defence Ministry was the first to point the finger at the US president's son, Hunter Biden, as one of those purportedly involved in financing alleged American biowarfare research in Ukrainian laboratories. On Friday, the Daily Mail rolled out a report, citing emails from the younger Biden's infamous laptop, that appeared to back the Russian ministry's assertions, unearthing details about how Hunter Biden allegedly used his leverage as a board member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to pour money into research of pandemic-causing pathogens in Ukraine. One might suggest that the move by the UK media outlet indicated the readiness of Western journalists to finally look into the long-dismissed allegations around Hunter Biden. But not everyone is so optimistic.  \"\"The Daily Mail report on Hunter Biden and Pentagon money for biolabs is what I would describe in American governmental jargon as a 'limited hangout'\"\", former US Senate candidate and investigative journalist Mark Dankof says.  The term \"\"limited hangout\"\" is used to describe the revelation of a portion of previously hidden information, which occurs when it is impossible to stick to the initial \"\"cover-up\"\" story, so that attention is drawn to it and the rest remains clandestine. Dankof pointed out that there have been other reports in Western alternative media that covered the story \"\"far more comprehensively, with a fair reference to specific Russian accusations and accompanying evidence\"\". What the Daily Mail did, he believes, is not about that, as comprehensive reporting from mainstream media outlets would prompt questions about the very core of the Western narrative.  \"\"If there were to be a fair and comprehensive coverage of the role of Nuland, the president of the United States and his derelict son, Hillary Clinton, the Pentagon, and the specific companies and financiers involved in this evil business, the average person in the UK, Western Europe, or the United States would begin to question the entire narrative of their respective governments and media on everything involving Ukraine from February of 2014 onward\"\", Dankof states.  The reason for rolling out a \"\"limited hangout\"\", he suggests, was the remarks by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. In her exchange with Senator Marco Rubio on the subject, Nuland confirmed the existence of biolaboratories in Ukraine, but denied the Russian accusations of the labs being used for the creation of biowarfare agents.  \"\"Yet Nuland committed a major mistake in subsequently expressing alarm that the labs might fall into Russian hands. Why the alarm, unless the accusations are true that the labs specifically exist for the purpose of developing weaponised biological and chemical agents?\"\", Dankof questions.  Independent journalist and writer Daniel Lazare also does not seem to be enthusiastic about the Daily Mail report, deeming it \"\"interesting but [far] from conclusive\"\". \"\"The Hunter Biden angle is fascinating, but sheds no light on the nature of such research\"\", he says. \"\"It's possible that the labs were engaged in biowar research, but such suspicions are still far from proven\"\". But Washington's official assurances that there was no biowarfare research in Ukraine is far from being persuasive as well, Lazare notes. \"\"Given all that, and given America's ample record of lying when it comes to WMDs, we can safely conclude that its assurances regarding the labs cannot be taken at face value and that the US should come clean before the appropriate international authorities\"\", he explains. \"\"That means making all relevant records public and submitting to public questioning concerning all aspects of the labs and their activities\"\".  Hunter Biden and Others  Hunter Biden, however, was not the only one to purportedly funnel money into the alleged bioweapons research in Ukraine. Some of the money for the Ukrainian biolabs was provided by the Pentagon, raising questions regarding how US taxpayer money is being used. Dankof notes that the decision to finance the Ukrainian laboratories instead of, say, channeling the money into important social issues is \"\"a more important policy and budgetary issue for all of the criminals in the Biden administration\"\". He also slams the \"\"supporters of this madness in both the GOP and the Democratic Party in Congress, and a servile mainstream media in the United States owned and staffed by the elite interests involved in this and in Bush's 'War on Terror' in the Middle East\"\".  \"\"It benefits no average American citizen\"\", he concludes.  Had the mainstream media paid enough attention to the Hunter Biden laptop story earlier, much more damning details would have emerged, Dankof believes, listing \"\"the criminal enterprises of Hillary Clinton just since 2016 and those of Hunter's own father\"\". Aside from this, he notes, the media's more thorough look inside the contents of the \"\"laptop from hell\"\" would have \"\"guaranteed the re-election of Donald Trump, something the American Deep State and its assets in [the] media and social media would not permit to happen\"\". The Biden administration does not seem to eager to address the issue, even though two-thirds of Americans, according to a recent Rassmussen poll, believe that the story about Hunter Biden's laptop is \"\"important\"\" and warrants further investigation. The reasons behind the White House's reluctance for such an investigation, Dankof says, are similar to those mentioned above. \"\"It would begin an unraveling of the real story on Joe and Hunter Biden; the president isn't going to honestly talk about [it] with the American public because he's a crook, as is his son and a whole host of players in the Ukrainian affair since February of 2014 that threatens to engulf all of us in World War III\"\", he says. Moreover, he continues, the White House appears to be prepared to attack anyone not ready to agree with the official narrative - just like Washington shielded its views on other controversial events. Among those who have already been attacked by the Western media over their disagreement with the mainstream view, Dankof referred to Tulsi Gabbard, whom Hillary Clinton once called a \"\"Russian asset\"\". Gabbard, for her part, had branded the then-Democratic candidate \"\"the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party\"\".  \"\"This overt character assassination of anyone who defies the official narrative of this criminal cabal compliments their silence on an entire body of authentic evidence on Russia and Ukraine, going back to the beginning of NATO expansion in 1997 and the Bill Clinton-NATO felonious aerial attack on Serbia in 1999\"\", he says. \"\"Some things never change\"\".  Since Gabbard weighed in to voice concerns about the American biolabs in Ukraine, she has yet again been labeled a \"\"Russian asset\"\" and a traitor by a handful of US lawmakers, among them GOP Senator Mitt Romney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger. In light of the findings by the Russian Defence Ministry, the Kremlin said it will demand an explanation from the United States regarding Hunter Biden's alleged involvement in the financing of biological research in Ukraine, with China also urging Washington to clarify the story around the alleged bioweapons. According to Russia, the United States has been pouring money into biological research in Ukraine aimed at potentially creating bioweapons or looking into the spread of dangerous pathogens. Aside from Hunter Biden, the Russian Defence Ministry found the US Agency for International Development (USAID), George Soros' Open Society Foundations, and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention also financed the research, which took place in 31 laboratories across 14 settlements in Ukraine. Ukraine is not the only country to have hosted the US-funded biolabs, Russia said, noting that similar research was conducted in Georgia, Indonesia, Germany, Azerbaijan and many other nations across the globe. The United States has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them part of a disinformation campaign, but Under Secretary Victoria Nuland in early March happened to confirm the existence of biolaboratories, saying that the US was \"\"quite concerned\"\" that Russian troops might take over the facilities.

Documentation on the urgent eradication of highly hazardous pathogens of plague, anthrax, rabbit-fever, cholera and other lethal diseases on February 24 was received from employees of Ukrainian biolaboratories. This included an instruction from the Ministry of Health of Ukraine on the urgent eradication of stored reserves of highly hazardous pathogens sent to all biolaboratories. These materials can be found on the internet portal of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation.  This documentation is now being thoroughly analysed by specialists of nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops. However, even at this point, we can conclude that components of biological weapons were being developed in Ukrainian laboratories in direct proximity to Russian territory. The urgent eradication of highly hazardous pathogens on February 24 was ordered to prevent exposing a violation of Article I of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) by Ukraine and the United States.  This information proves that the claims we have repeatedly made with regard to the military biological activity of the United States and their allies in the post-Soviet space within the framework of the BTWC were justified. We cannot rule out using the mechanisms in Articles V and VI of the BTWC, pursuant to which the member states shall consult with each other to resolve any issues regarding the purpose of the Convention or the execution of its provisions, and cooperate in any investigation of possible violations of the obligations under the BTWC.   Decisive actions to strengthen the BTWC regime are required to prevent any military biological activity carried out in violation of the BTWC. We call for the resumption of work on a legally binding Protocol to the Convention with an effective verification mechanism, something the United States has been blocking since 2001. In this context, we call for the creation of an open-ended group as part of the BTWC, which is in the interests of the overwhelming majority of member states.  To strengthen the institutional foundation of the Convention we promote initiatives, which have wide international support, to create mobile medical and biological units within the framework of the BTWC (to render assistance if biological weapons are being used and to fight outbreaks of various origins) and to establish a Research Advisory Committee (to analyse scientific and technical achievements and to provide the states with appropriate recommendations).  In addition, we suggest including information on military biological activities carried out abroad in annual reports provided by the BTWC member states as part of confidence-building measures.  Only comprehensive steps like these will make it possible to place the military biological activity of the United States and their allies in the post-Soviet space, as well as other regions of the world, under close international control and ensure the verifiable compliance of the BTWC member states with their obligations.", "publication_date": "2022-03-08"}, {"headline": "Putin on Ukraine and the West: Key takeaways from latest speech", "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/552096-putin-ukraine-west-speech/", "content": "The collective West clinging on its \u201ccrumbling dominance\u201d has been the ultimate driver of the crisis, Russian president says  President Vladimir Putin gave an extensive speech on the Ukrainian crisis on Wednesday, as he met with regional heads to discuss measures of socioeconomic support to counter the wave of anti-Russian sanctions. Putin provided his take on the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, its causes, and the goals Russia pursues.  Conflict was inevitable  Launching the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was the only option Russia had left to end the years-long bloodshed in eastern Ukraine, Putin stressed. At the same time, limiting its scope to the breakaway Donbass republics only would only push the \u201cfrontline\u201d westwards, rather than defuse the situation, he noted.  While waging the war against the breakaway regions of Donbass, Kiev has been preparing for a broad offensive to re-capture them, Putin said, adding that \u201calmost 14,000 civilians, including children, have been killed\u201d in the conflict. Ukrainian authorities also sought to attack Crimea, which split from the country back in 2014 and joined Russia via a referendum.  \u201cEncouraged by the United States and other Western countries, Ukraine was purposefully preparing for a scenario of force, a massacre and an ethnic cleansing in Donbass. A massive onslaught on Donbass and later Crimea was just a matter of time. However, our Armed Forces have shattered these plans,\u201d Putin said.  Kiev actively sought weapons of mass destruction  Ukrainian authorities have openly stated their goal to obtain weapons of mass destruction, namely nuclear bombs and means of their delivery, Russia\u2019s president has said. Given the extremely hostile attitude of Kiev, such systems would have been used to target Russia once they were ready.  READ MORE: WHO advised Kiev to destroy disease-causing pathogens \u2013 media  Putin also touched upon the Ukrainian biolab network allegations, raised by the Russian military amid the offensive. The facilities scattered across the country have allegedly been engaged in biological weapons development with direct support of Washington. The allegations, backed by documents published by the Russian military, have been met with varying degrees of denial from the top US officials.  \u201cThere was a network of dozens of laboratories in Ukraine, where military biological programs were conducted under the guidance and with the financial support of the Pentagon, including experiments with coronavirus strains, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other deadly diseases,\u201d Putin said, adding that now \u201cfrantic attempts\u201d are underway to conceal the \u201ctraces of these secret programs.\u201d  Ukraine established as \u2018anti-Russia\u2019  Over the past few years, under the close guidance of their Western handlers, the Kiev authorities have morphed Ukraine into \u201canti-Russia\u201d, Putin suggested. The only goal of the incumbent Kiev \u201cregime\u201d is to drag the conflict on for as long as possible, with little regard to the fate of the civilians or destruction that ensues.  \u201cWe are seeing again and again that the Kiev regime, for which its Western masters have set the task of creating an aggressive \u2018anti-Russia\u2019, is indifferent to the fate of the people of Ukraine themselves,\u201d Putin said.  \u201cIt is also obvious that the Western handlers are simply pushing the Kiev authorities to continue the bloodshed. They are supplied with more and more weaponry batches, they are provided with intelligence, they also receive other assistance, including military advisers and mercenaries.\u201d  Kiev & West exhibit \u2018shocking cynicism\u2019  Both Ukrainian authorities and the collective West have exhibited \u201cshocking cynicism\u201d amid the conflict, Putin said, offering the ballistic missile strike on the center of Donetsk that occurred on Monday as an example of such behavior. The strike killed at least 20 civilians.

They are acting like the Nazis did when they tried to drag as many innocent victims as they could to their graves,\u201d Putin said, adding that Kiev had tried to blame the strike on Russia through \u201cblatant lies.\u201d  The attitude of \u201cthe so-called civilized world\u201d to the missile strike turned to be \u201cshocking in its extreme cynicism\u201d as well, the president went on.  \u201cThe European and American press did not even notice this tragedy in Donetsk, as if nothing happened,\u201d Putin said. \u201cJust like they have been hypocritically looking the other way over the past eight years as mothers buried their children in Donbass, as elderly people were killed. This is simply moral degradation, complete de-humanization.\u201d  Crumbling dominance of the West behind global turmoil  Ultimately, the West\u2019s desire to maintain its global dominance is the root of the ongoing Ukrainian turmoil, as well as crises in the other parts of the globe, Putin believes.  READ MORE: West\u2019s global political and economic dominance ends \u2013 Putin  \u201cToday, the entire planet has to pay the price for the ambitions of the West, for its attempts by any means to maintain its crumbling dominance,\u201d he said.  Concerned only with their \u201cvested interests and super profits,\u201d the Western elites led the world into the current situation through \u201cyears of mistakes and short-sited decisions.\u201d  For instance, the impact of the anti-Russian sanctions, imposed over the Ukrainian conflict, is already being felt by the common people in the West \u2013 while the elites have been bizarrely trying to blame it on Moscow, Putin noted.  I want ordinary Western people to hear me as well. You are being persistently told that your current difficulties are the result of Russia\u2019s hostile actions and that you have to pay from your own pockets for the efforts to counter the alleged Russian threat.

The Russian military published classified documents belonging to the Ukrainian National Guard last week which appeared to confirm Kiev\u2019s plans to start a fresh offensive in the Donbass in March of 2022. Kiev made no secret of its militarization activities, with an analysis of the website of the country\u2019s main defence contractor Ukroboronprom showing a 27.4 percent increase in production in 2021, and a whopping 48 percent growth in output in January 2022.

US officials and media initially dismissed the Russian reports as fake news and disinformation. However, undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland confirmed last week that Ukraine hosts \u201cbiological research facilities,\u201d and said Washington was \u201cquite concerned\u201d that the \u201cresearch materials\u201d contained therein might fall into the hands of Russian troops.

A $2.1 billion-dollar operation exploring some of the deadliest viruses in at least 30 laboratories \u2013 under the patronage of the Pentagon and three private companies: this is the US\u2019s illusive bio labs program. Operating in 25 states, it employs civilians who have no accountability before Congress and can bypass the law due to the lack of direct oversight. The program whose existence has been confirmed by none other than Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland at a Senate Committee hearing on March 8th has been dismissed by the majority of American mainstream media as \u201cconspiracy\u201d in a desperate effort to sweep under the rug one of America\u2019s best kept secrets inside Ukraine.

So what exactly has been going on in the US bio labs in Ukraine?  Covert Work on Deadly Viruses  The bio laboratories are operated by the DTRA military program. Furthermore, civilian personnel of these private companies can operate on behalf of the US government under diplomatic cover \u2013 a practice commonly resorted to by the CIA. \u00a9 AFP 2022 / STAFF The Pentagon building in Washington, DC The Pentagon building in Washington, DC \u00a9 AFP 2022 / STAFF There are three such companies operating in Ukraine - Metabiota Inc., Southern Research Institute and Black&Veatch, with key posts held by former, and in some cases, current high-ranking military and intelligence officers. Besides the Pentagon, these companies run federal biological research projects for the CIA and other government agencies. According to various sources, the DTRA finances about 15 biological laboratories in Ukraine, with data accumulated on ten of them: 1. Ternopol Regional Laboratory Center, Ternopil, Fedkovicha st. 13 2. Kherson diagnostic laboratory (Kherson regional laboratory center), Kherson, st. Uvarova, 3 3. Institute of Veterinary Medicine of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine 4. Vinnitsa diagnostic laboratory (Vinnitsa regional laboratory center), Vinnitsa, st. Malinovsky, 11 5.

Krupyarska, 27  US Firms Win Hefty Contracts  In accordance with an agreement between the US Department of Defense and Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Health, dated 2005, the Kiev government is prohibited from disclosing any \"\"sensitive\"\" information about the American program. In the meantime Ukraine is under obligation to transfer dangerous pathogens from the labs on its territory to the Pentagon for further biological research, in return the US military is granted access to Ukraine\u2019s state secrets related to the ongoing projects. However, a certain US-funded organization, \u201cThe Science and Technology Center in Ukraine\u201d (STCU), was set up the country even before the agreement in question. With its employees endowed with diplomatic status, the center officially supports the projects of scientists who previously worked on Soviet programs to create weapons of mass destruction. Over the past 20 years, STCU has funneled $285 million in funding and managed an estimated 1850 projects worldwide, The work is officially carried out in line with the 1991-launched programme to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The stated goal is to ensure safe storage and destruction of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery, in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Since Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan destroyed their arsenal of nuclear warheads, on paper the program ended in 2013. However, in 2021, a bill was introduced in the US Congress to renew the programme ostensibly to the \u201creemerged threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation\u201d. However, according to the Federal Public Procurement website, the programme never actually stopped its operation. In 2013, one of the DTRA contractors for the programme's execution in Ukraine was Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, with the contract worth $ 43.9 million. In 2016, the STCU itself won a five-year DTRA contract to provide scientific and technical services to a tune of $10 million. Currently, there is no clarity regarding the scope of the STCU\u2019s ongoing activity in Ukraine. Location of US Biolaborations in Ukraine Location of US Biolaborations in Ukraine  Deadly Outbreaks in Ukraine: The Worrysome Coincidence  While not all of the research is traceable to a tee, US Biolabs mushrooming across Ukraine soil and the American financing of STCU projects coincided with several outbreaks of serious infectious diseases in the country. In January 2016 at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers died of a flu-like virus within a matter of two days in Kharkov, home to one of the US-run laboratories. More than 200 people were hospitalized at the time. By March 2016, 364 fatal cases were recorded throughout Ukraine. The cause of 81% of deaths was swine influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 \u2013 the same one that triggered a global pandemic of the disease in 2009. More recently, another sudden outbreak of an infectious disease, Hepatitis A, was registered in the south-east of Ukraine \u2013 also the site of several Pentagon biolabs. Last January, 37 residents of Nikolaev were hospitalized with jaundice, prompting local police to launch an investigation into suspected \"\"deliberate infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and other incurable diseases.\u201d Three years ago, more than 100 people in that same city fell ill with cholera. In both cases, it was assumed that the cause was contaminated drinking water. Back in the summer of 2017, 60 people were hospitalized with Hepatitis A in Zaporozhye \u2013 the cause of that outbreak remains unknown. In Odessa region, 19 children had the same diagnosis, while in November 2017, 27 cases were registered in Kharkov. The virus was discovered in potable water. Ukraine witnessed an outbreak of cholera in 2011, with 33 people hospitalized with diarrhea. In 2014, more than 800 people were diagnosed with cholera, with cases spread out across the country.  Dangerous Parallels  While the outbreaks themselves are hardly evidence enough of any foul play, the diseases in question correlate curiously with the list of the dangerous pathogen s the US laboratories have been researching. For example, the Southern Research Institute has a project on cholera, as well as viruses of influenza and Zika \u2013 all of them designated by the Pentagon as pathogens of military importance. Besides the Southern Research Institute, laboratories in Ukraine are managed by two other companies, Black&Veatch and Metabiota. DTRA DTRA  Black & Veatch  Founded in 1915 in Kansas City, Missouri, Black & Veatch is currently headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas. It specializes in mining, data centers, smart cities, banking and financial markets. In 2020, Black & Veatch was the 7th largest company in the US, boasting a revenue of $3.7 billion in 2020. The activity of Black & Veatch, with a web of over 100 offices around the world, since its inception has been inextricably linked with the US army and intelligence agencies. Black&Veatch won two five-year DTRA contracts worth $198.7 million to build and manage bio laboratories in Ukraine, Germany, Azerbaijan, Cameroon, Thailand, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Armenia. The Federal Purchasing website states that in Ukraine alone Pentagon contractor Black&Veatch has DTRA commitments in line with the \"\"Biological Joint Participation Program\"\" worth $140 million since 2013, with work to a tune of $ 77 million yet to be completed. In 2014, Metabiota, specializing in identifying, monitoring and analysing potential disease outbreaks, signed an $18.4 million federal contract as a subcontractor for Black & Veatch in Georgia and Ukraine.  Southern Research  Non-profit Southern Research first founded in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1941, as the Alabama Research Institute, conducts fundamental and applied research for commercial and non-profit organizations in four areas: development of medicine, energy, environment and engineering. Throughout the past 70 years, Southern Research has been engaged in research activities linked with national defense. Its early programs for the US Department of Defense included the development of heat- resistant materials for rocket systems returning to Earth's atmosphere. Over the decades, Southern Research expanded the direction of its work to the development of ballistic missile systems, hypersonic vehicles, etc. New Unsealed Docs Show US Firm Sent Virus Similar to COVID-19 to Wuhan Lab 21 November 2021, 17:11 GMT Since 2008, Southern Research Institute has been the main subcontractor in Ukraine. In 2001 the firm became a Pentagon subcontractor for anthrax research. The main contractor was Advanced Biosystems, led at the time by Ken Alibek, a former Soviet microbiologist and expert in biological weapons from Kazakhstan, who left for the US in 1992. Southern Research Institute is known for actively lobbying research programmes for US intelligence in Congress and the State Department at around the same time that bio laboratories began to emerge in Ukraine and other countries of the former USSR. Thus, the company paid $250,000 to Senator Jeff Sessions (now -US Attorney General) for his lobbying services in 2008-2009, when the Institute won several federal contracts. Overall, from 2006 until 2016, Southern Research Institute forked out some $1.28 million on lobbying to the Senate, House of Representatives, Department of State and Department of Defense.  Metabiota Inc.  Finally, Metabiota Inc. is the most private of the above-mentioned companies, linked to the biolabs in Ukraine. This could be explained by its links with the family of the President of the United States, Joe Biden, more specifically, his son, Hunter Biden. Founded in 2008, Metabiota is commissioned by governments, insurance companies and livestock breeders to research and evaluate infectious disease threats, digitize global microbial data and actively avert the spread of diseases. At the first stage, it was financed by Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), an offshoot of Rosemont Capital, an investment fund founded by Hunter Biden, the son of US President Joe Biden, and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former US Secretary of State John Kerry in 2009, in which Biden was managing director. Hunter Biden\u2019s shady former overseas dealings, which concealed a web of corruption in which he sought to use his father\u2019s notoriety to secure unscrupulous business deals from Ukraine to Hong Kong, have swirled for years, but yielded no action on the part of the US or International authorities so far with an investigation still underway. Metabiota is listed in the archived portfolios of RSTP, with financial reports showing RSTP covered the first round of financing for the company to a tune of $30 million. Since 2014, Metabiota has been a partner of the EcoHealth Alliance within the PREDICT Project of the project of USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, which aims to carry out global surveillance for pathogens to ostensibly \"\" identify and prevent the threat of new emerging infectious diseases\u201d. However, as part of these efforts, researchers from Metabiota, EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology jointly conducted a study on infectious diseases of bats in China. \u00a9 AFP 2022 / HECTOR RETAMAL An aerial view shows the P4 laboratory (L) at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on April 17, 2020 An aerial view shows the P4 laboratory (L) at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on April 17, 2020 \u00a9 AFP 2022 / HECTOR RETAMAL Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance and Metabiota also collaborated over controversial projects on how to \"\"live safely with bats\"\", and research linking emerging infectious disease outbreaks with trade in wild animals. Researchers from Metabiota were also listed along with EcoHealth Alliance staff in a 2014 study on the dissemination of the Nipah henipavirus, Ebola monitoring study in 2014, herpes study in 2015. In April 2021, USAID announced a new taxpayer-funded project, led by the EcoHealth Alliance, to track new infections diseases with pandemic potential. Metabiota, whose researchers were listed as authors of articles dated June 2021 related to coronavirus surveillance in Africa, are also linked to the new project spearheaded by EcoHealth Alliance. Metabiota has long been connected to a well-known controversial CIA front, In-Q-Tel, created in 1999 as \"\"the first state-sponsored venture capital company\u201d. In-Q-Tel is an American non-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia, founded to boost national security by \"\"connecting the Central Intelligence Agency and US intelligence community with venture-backed entrepreneurial companies\"\". The firm, founded by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, and Gilman Louis, who was the first CEO of In Q-Tel, is considered a trendsetter in the information technology industry. In-Q-Tel received funding for at least $120 million in 2016, mainly from the CIA, but also the NSA, FBI and US Department of Defense While In-Q-Tel operates partially publicly, there is a shroud of secrecy over its products and their use, with the most famous known ones being analytical systems for Palantir Technologies data analysis and encrypted messages sharing application. Situation in Ukraine Kiev Regime Sought to Scrub Evidence of Pentagon-backed Biowarfare Programme, Russian MoD Reveals 6 March, 15:41 GMT With documents in hand, Russia addressed the damning evidence pertaining to the US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. On 11 March the UN Security Council gathered for a special meeting convened at Russia\u2019s request to discuss the issue. However, the UN Under-Secretary-General of Disarmament Affairs, Izumi Nakamitsu, said the UN was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. Washington was quick to denounce Russia\u2019s claims, with Ned Price, spokesperson for the Department of State, accusing it of \u201cinventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own actions in Ukraine.\u201d Situation in Ukraine Russia to Demand Explanation Over Hunter Biden's Links to Biolabs in Ukraine, Kremlin Says 25 March, 10:01 GMT Russia will demand an explanation of the involvement of Hunter Biden, the son of the American President, in funding pathogen research in Ukraine, said the Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. \"\"...This is very sensitive information - both for us and for the whole world. Of course, we will demand explanations. And we are not alone in it: you know that China has already demanded clarifications from the US, urging them to make this situation transparent to the world...\"\" emphasized Peskov.", "publication_date": "2022-03-25"}, {"headline": "Moscow rejects Washington\u2019s chemical-weapons claim", "url": "https://www.rt.com/russia/551742-moscow-washington-chemical-weapons/", "content": "A State Department warning that Russia could use chemical weapons in Ukraine is baseless, Moscow insists  Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington accused the Americans on Saturday of trying to \u201cdemonize\u201d Moscow, rejecting a US State Department allegation that his country may deploy chemical weapons in Ukraine.  \u201cThe US official, as always, did not bother to provide any evidence. This is another attempt to demonize our country,\u201d Anatoly Antonov said, adding that such claims were \u201cnot worth a penny.\u201d  Citing a paper from Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the official then suggested that Ukrainian \u201cradical groups\u201d \u2013 allegedly \u201c[trained] under the control of the representatives of American special services\u201d \u2013 could have themselves \u201cprepared several potential scenarios of the use of toxic chemicals in order to carry out various types of provocations.\u201d  \u201cOur country, unlike the United States, eliminated all available stocks of chemical warfare agents in 2017. This fact has been documented by the OPCW. It is pointless to argue with this fact,\u201d Antonov concluded, in reference to the fact that US chemical warfare stockpiles have yet to be completely decommissioned.  The Russian government has claimed that Ukrainian groups backed by the US could be preparing a false-flag chemical attack in order to \u201caccuse Russia of the use of chemical weapons against the civil population and violating its obligations.\u201d The US and Ukraine have denied such claims.  State Department spokesperson Ned Price suggested on Wednesday that Russia could use chemical weapons in Ukraine.  \u201cRussia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating,\u201d he said, calling Moscow\u2019s warnings \u201can obvious ploy.\u201d  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki claimed this week that Russia could \u201cuse chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine\u201d or \u201ccreate a false-flag operation\u201d with such weapons. Psaki added that the world should \u201cbe on the lookout.\u201d  Psaki dismissed Moscow\u2019s suggestions that the US and Ukraine could conduct a similar false-flag attack, calling them \u201cfalse claims\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d  Read more US won\u2019t track citizens who travel to Ukraine to fight  The press secretary argued that Moscow\u2019s claims were an \u201cobvious ploy\u201d to justify further military action in Ukraine.

In a tweet posted on Sunday, Gabbard cited the risk posed by the \u201c25 to 30\u201d such research facilities in Ukraine which \u201cif breached would release and spread deadly pathogens to the US and the world.\u201d She called for all parties, including Russia, Ukraine and NATO to take immediate action to prevent a possible disaster from unfolding and implementing a ceasefire around such labs until they are secure and the pathogens are destroyed.  There are 25+ US-funded biolabs in Ukraine which if breached would release & spread deadly pathogens to US/world. We must take action now to prevent disaster.

The Daily Beast even published a report alleging that Gabbard was paid off by a suspected Russian agent during her run for the presidency when a dual Russian-American national contributed to her campaign.  During a recent appearance on \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019, Gabbard responded to the accusations, saying, \u201cthis is not a matter of disagreement or holding a dissenting view. This is about facts and this is about the truth,\u201d adding that no amount of \u201cregurgitating Hillary Clinton\u2019s slanderous talking points\u201d can change the facts.  She reiterated that, contrary to what the media is reporting, she never claimed there were bioweapon labs in Ukraine, but that there are \u201cbiolabs in Ukraine that have received US support that contain dangerous pathogens\u201d that if released, could mean the world would face a \u201cfuture of pandemics.\u201d Gabbard called for the issue to be addressed immediately and for the pathogens to be secured or destroyed.  Gabbard went on to blast the media for trying to deny these biolabs are even there, despite \u201cthe plethora of evidence that exists,\u201d calling it shocking that news outlets are trying to play up these biolabs as some sort of fantasy while several US officials and departments have publicly expressed concern that the pathogens contained in the biolabs in Ukraine could be released.  The former congresswoman added that the media is blatantly lying to the American people, and responded to the accusations of her campaign receiving funds from supposed Russian agents, saying: \u201cYou saw headlines a couple of days ago: \u2018Tulsi Gabbard Paid Off By Russian Agents.\u2019  \u201cWhat the media is lying about is the fact that an American citizen gave my campaign a $59 contribution coming from a woman I\u2019ve never met, someone I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know anything about, but somehow they feel justified in saying, \u2018Tulsi Gabbard is being paid off.\u2019\u201d  Gabbard highlighted the dangers that come from the media deceiving the public so blatantly, saying these \u201cso-called journalists have a responsibility to the public,\u201d and if they keep getting away with these lies with no accountability, it poses \u201ca direct threat to our democratic republic.\u201d  \u201cThey continue to parrot and propagate these lies and they need to be held accountable.
